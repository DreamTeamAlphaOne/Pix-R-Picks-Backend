ON BLACK
Lightning flash! 

Torrential rain. Dark skies.

CHYRON: Nine Years Ago

The tone is ominous and quiet. Too quiet.

We PULL BACK to reveal...ANDYÕS ROOM

JESSIE and BULLSEYE stare out the window. Worried.
JESSIE
Whoa! ItÕs raining cats and dogs 
out there! I hope they make it back 

alright...
FOOTSTEPS. Coming fast. The few toys littered about the room 

race back to their places.
HAMM 
Heads up! AndyÕs coming!
ANDY (8) bursts in. Slightly wet, but triumphant.
Dumps an arm-full of toys on his bed: WOODY, BUZZ, REX, 
SLINKY, THE POTATO HEADS, THE ALIENS. Equally wet. Stained 

with grass and dirt.
ANDYÕS MOM (O.S.)
Andy! Time for dinner.
ANDY
Yes! IÕm starving!
Andy runs out, leaving the door ajar. We LISTEN TO THE 

FOOTSTEPS descend...fade away...and...
THUNDER -- THE TOYS JUMP TO LIFE IN A COMPLETE PANIC
!!
WoodyÕs already at the windowsill, searching. Buzz is close 
behind.
BUZZ
Do you see him?
WOODY
No.
SLINKY DOG
Well, heÕs done for.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARREX
HeÕll be lost! Forever!
WOODY
Jessie. Buzz. Slink. MollyÕs room.
Woody is already on the move.
WOODY (CONT'D)
The rest of you stay put.
ON UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Woody checks the coast is clear...sneaks fast across the 
exposed expanse to MOLLYÕS OPEN DOOR. Peers in...
BO PEEP (+ SHEEP) stands on HER LAMP. The rotating lampshade 
casting POINTS OF LIGHT, like stars, around the room. 
Woody smiles at the sight of her. Steps forward -- then jumps 
back as MOLLY (6) runs out and downstairs. That was close.
Woody waves for Jessie, Slinky and Buzz to follow him...

INTO MOLLYÕS ROOM

Bo comes to life, ready for action. Offers her staff to pull 
Woody up to the nightstand.
BO
Situation?
WOODY
Lost toy. Side yard.
BO
(hushed, urgent)
Billy. Goat. Gruff. Raise the 

blinds.
Her sheep BLEAT. Take a flying leap off the nightstand with 

the cord in their mouths, raising the blinds as they descend.
WOODY
They have names? You never told me 

that.
BO
You never asked.
Woody, Bo, Jessie and Buzz at the window, searching.

Where is he?
FLASH OF LIGHTNING!!
WOODY
There!
ItÕs RC CAR. Stuck in the drivewayÕs CHANNEL DRAIN. His 
wheels spin desperately as rainwater rushes past him.
BUZZ
How do we reach him?
Bo and Woody share a look.
BO/WOODY
Operation Pull-Toy!
They look to their respective toys:
WOODY
Slink!
SLINKY DOG
You got it Woody!
BO
Barbies!
The Barbies parkour up a tall dresser as a ROW OF BIRTHDAY 

DOLLS create a CHILDRENÕS BOOK SEE-SAW on the lower 

nightstand. Jessie crouches on one end of the book. Ready.
BO
Go!
The Barbies jump down on the bookÕs other end, flinging 

Jessie up to the TOP OF THE WINDOW SILL. She tugs open the 

lock. Voil⁄.
 Window open. Rain sprays in.
BO
Flashlight!
The light sweeps down on RC, struggling against the current.
Woody squeezes his mid-section just behind the FRONT END OF 
SLINKY, wearing him like a life-preserver.
Bo makes sure WoodyÕs secure. Straightens his hat. Looks into 
his eyes. A small confident smile: we can do this.
She HOOKS HER STAFF to SLINKYÕS TAIL. Other toys grab hold.
3.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWoody and Slinky drop...
SIDE DRIVEWAY

...and land. Through SHEETS OF RAIN, they spot RC on the 
other side. The toy car tries to reach them, but only slips 

farther down the drain towards the streetÕs RUSHING RIVER!
Woody crosses the driveway, stretching Slinky as far as he 
can...comes up short. Has to separate from Slinky, and hold 

his paw, to extend his reach. Not enough...RC slips further, 

when -- Woody suddenly can grab hold of RC! 
...He looks back to BO AT THE WINDOW. A CHAIN OF ÒBARREL FULL 
OF MONKEYSÓ now extends from her staff to SlinkÕs tail. Phew!
-- 
a CAR pulls into the driveway!
Headlights LIGHT UP WOODY. The three toys go still and are 
SHOT BACK to the house. Slam against the siding.
Unawares, a MAN (VISTOR FATHER) jumps out of the car and 
rushes to the front door.
ON MOLLYÕS WINDOW

The toys drag Slinky back up. Pull RC inside first. Bo smiles 
down at Woody as he climbs. They did it -- Suddenly Bo turns 

back inside...
SLAM! THE WINDOW SHUTS ON SLINKY!

OUTSIDE

Woody clambers up. PEEKS INSIDE to see...

...Mom grab Bo Peep.
VISITOR FATHER
Oh, it's beautiful...
ANDYÕS MOM
...IÕm so glad to see this old lamp 
go to a good home. We've had it 

since Molly was a baby.
To WoodyÕs shock; Mom places Bo, her sheep, and lamp into a 

CARDBOARD BOX.
VISITOR FATHER
Molly, are you sure itÕs alright?
4.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARMOLLY
Yeah, I donÕt want it anymore.
Woody watches, helpless, as Mom hands off the box to the 
Visitor Father. They head back downstairs...
INSIDE

The toys jump up! Throw open the window! Pull up Slinky Dog 
and...nobody else?
BUZZ
WhereÕs Woody?
OUTSIDE
The Visitor Father walks to the trunk of his car. Sets the 
box down to search his pockets. Jogs back to the house and 

knocks. Mom answers...
VISITOR FATHER
Yeah hi, I think I left my keys in 

here...
In that unattended moment, BOÕS BOX IS SUDDENLY DRAGGED... 
UNDER THE CAR

LIGHTNING FLASHES to reveal Woody opening the box. Bo is 
comforting her sheep in the darkness.
BO
WOODY-- !
WOODY
Quick! WeÕll sneak in the hedges 

before heÕs back--
BO
Woody, itÕs okay...
WOODY
Wha--? No! No, no. You canÕt go. 

WhatÕs best for Andy is that you--
BO
Woody. IÕm not AndyÕs toy.
WOODY
Wha-- What?
Woody goes still. Looks at Bo. SheÕs right.
5.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
ItÕs time for the next kid.
The two toys check the front door as they HEAR THE VISITOR 
FATHER SAY HIS GOODBYES -- Time is running out. Bo looks back 

to Woody. Hesitant. 
BO
You know...kids lose their toys 

every day. Sometimes they get left 

in the yard...or put in the wrong 

box...
Woody looks from Bo to the box. The sheep back up to make 

room. He understands.
WOODY
And that box...gets taken away.
A small hopeful nod from Bo. Woody places his hands on the 

edge of the box --
ANDY (O.S.)
Mom, whereÕs Woody?
Woody is drawn to the sound of AndyÕs voice
. The boy is now 
searching the yard.
ANDYÕS MOM
Andy! Come inside!
ANDY
I canÕt find Woody!
Bo watches WOODYÕS HANDS slip away from the box. His eyes 

then meet hers. He canÕt do it.
Bo gives a pained smile of understanding.

She straightens WoodyÕs hat one last time. Gently touches his 
face.
WIDE ON THE CAR

The Visitor Father exits the house...
VISITOR FATHER
Well, good night.
...as the box scoots back out from under the car.
ANDY'S MOM
Goodbye! Drive safe.
6.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARMOMENTS LATER
The car backs out of the driveway to reveal...

WOODY

lying in the exposed rainy driveway. His eyes watch the TAIL 
LIGHTS SHRINK and disappear in the driving rain...then go 

lifeless as...
ANDY
There you are!
...Andy picks him up.
ANDY
Mom I found him! I found him!
ANDY'S MOM
(chuckle)
Oh good. Come on, get inside.
Andy runs to the warm light of the open front door.
WE RISE UP IN THE AIR. The rain clears. The sky goes from 
dark to light until we see...WHITE CLOUDS IN A BLUE SKY that 

recall AndyÕs wallpaper.

As ÒYOUÕVE GOT A FRIEND IN MEÓ
 PLAYS we FOLLOW WOODY through 
the years:

Young Andy gallops Woody around his backyard. He swings his 
the doll. We see ÒANDYÓ written on the SOLE OF HIS BOOT...
...A year later, Andy flies Jessie and Buzz around his 
bedroom...
...Now a slightly older Andy runs down the street. Buzz in 
one hand, Woody in the other...
...OUTSIDE BONNIEÕS HOUSE, a YOUNG ADULT ANDY hands Woody 
lovingly over to BONNIE (4) She hugs Woody, then jumps to her 

feet and flies the doll around the yard...
...Bonnie in her backyard, swinging with HER TOYS, now 
mingled with ANDYÕS TOYS. Woody SWINGS AT CAMERA...
...then PULLS AWAY. Now in BONNIEÕS ROOM. She sets Woody 
aside. Flies the other toys around the room in a box made to 

look like an airplane. DISSOLVE TO...

BUZZ (O.S.)
I know that was you, Potato Head.
A MISCHIEVOUS CHORTLE from Potato Head. 
Reveal ALL OF BONNIEÕS TOYS are crammed INSIDE A DARK CLOSET, 
like soldiers on a Higgins boat, waiting to storm the beach.
DOLLY stands on a STACK OF GAMES, looking over the squished 
toy troops. She addresses them like their CO:
DOLLY
Everyone listen, I thought I told 

you -- when Mom quickly cleans the 

bedroom like that, expect to be put 

in the closet.
Rex WAILS. Woody gets to his feet.
REX
How much longer?
WOODY
Keep it to a dull roar, Rex.
He wanders through the ranks, checking in on his pals. Jessie 

is HYPERVENTILATING. Slinky is nervously wagging.
8.

Deep breaths, Jessie. Deep breaths.
(to SlinkÕs back-end)
Settle down, Slink. Sit, good boy.
He meets up with Dolly, whoÕs been clocking him.
DOLLY
Sheriff, do I need to be worried?
WOODY
Nah. My guys are veterans. TheyÕll 
hang in there.
DOLLY
Good. Just keepÕem calm until we 

get word.
WOODY
Yes, maÕam.
Dolly PEERS THROUGH THE SLATS to a TOY HANGING FROM THE 

DOORKNOB of BonnieÕs bedroom door. It shakes its head. 

Nothing yet.
Woody paces near BUZZ.
BUZZ
How are you, uh... feeling about 
today?
WOODY
Uh, good, good. Yeah...good. IÕm 

good.
BUZZ
Uh... good.
IN THE BEDROOM
The doorknob toy suddenly kicks its legs, BELLS CHIME.
DOLLY

©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARDOLLY
Thanks, Woody. I got it.
WOODY
Yes, IÕm sorry. YouÕre right, 
youÕre right...
FOOTSTEPS!! The toys drop. The CLOSET DOOR flies open, 

revealing Bonnie!
BONNIE
The town is open!
QUICK CUTS to individual toys picked up for playtime:
BONNIE
Hi, Mayor!
(grabs Dolly...)
--Banker--
(Hamm)
--Hi, Ice Cream Man--
(Slinky Dog)
--Hi, Hat Shop Owner--
(Trixie)
--Mail Man--
(Buzz)
--AND the sheriff!
Bonnie picks up Woody. Plucks HIS BADGE from his shirt. Drops 

him back on the floor.
BONNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, bye toys!
The closet doors shuts.
From his dumped position, Woody can see THROUGH THE SLATS as 
Bonnie plays with Jessie, now wearing his badge.
BONNIE
YEE-HA! Sheriff Jessie! Giddy-up 

Bullseye!
Woody sits up.
ItÕs just him and the TODDLER TOYS Bonnie has outgrown, and 
left in the closet. Awkward silence.
Woody feigns disinterest. Stretches. Nothing to see here. 
Starts playing solitaire with a stray deck of cards. An ÒOLD 

TIMERÓ TOY CLOCK watches him deal.
10.

You have so many hats for sale!
The toddler toysÕ attention shifts to BonnieÕs play. They 
shuffle over to THE DOOR SLATS to watch.
MELEPHANT BROOKS
Wow... theyÕre doing Òhat shopÓ.
CARL REINEROCEROS
WhenÕs the last time we ever got to 

play that?
CHAIROL BURNETT
Remember when she played house?
MELEPHANT BROOKS
I liked ÒHouseÓ.
BITEY WHITE
Those were the days.
MELEPHANT BROOKS
It was basic. You made a house, you

ON WOODY AND OLD TIMER
OLD TIMER
ThatÕs the third time you havenÕt

WOODY

WOODY
Okay, okay, okay I get it. ItÕs 

been awhile.

Ooh looky there, you got your first 

dust bunny.
Woody picks a BALL OF DUST out of his holster.
CHAIROL BURNETT
Awww, how adorable. Whatcha gonna 

name it?
11.

What about Dusty?
As Woody tries to shake off the dust, the TODDLER TOYS DEBATE 
over a name:
TODDLER TOYS
Francis?...Harry...Karen...Fuzzball

...Le Bron?...No, Fluffy...How 

Ôbout Thumper?...Tumbleweed?... 

ÒTumbleweed.Ó Oh thatÕs good, 

thatÕs good...Well, heÕs a cowboy 

so that makes a lot of sense...
Woody ignores them. PEERS THROUGH THE SLATS at the play.
BONNIEÕS DAD enters.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Bonnie? Go get your shoes on, we 
gotta go. You donÕt want to be late 

for kindergarten orientation do 

you?
Bonnie deflates. Eyes downcast...
BONNIE
But...I don't want to go.
BONNIEÕS DAD
We talked about this. WeÕre going 

to meet your teachers, see your 

classroom--
BONNIE
Can I bring a toy?
BONNIEÕS DAD
Toys donÕt go to school, thatÕs the 

rule.
WOODY watches Dad lead her out of the room. Door shuts.
-- Dolly pops up! Runs the room like a frustrated mother:
DOLLY
Freeze! Nobody move! Bonnie always 
forgets something. SheÕll be back 

any second.
Slinky stops in his tracks, slinky coil quivering.

Hamm is reaching for a coin on the floor.
HAMM
But itÕs money!
ON THE CLOSET
Woody emerges. Heads for Dolly. Passes Buzz and Jessie...
BUZZ
You alright, Woody? IÕm sure sheÕll 
pick you next time.
WOODY
Come on. IÕm fine, no problem.
Jessie hands Woody back his BADGE.
JESSIE
Hey, Woody. Here.
WOODY
Oh, thanks, Jessie.
BUZZ
WeÕre here for you buddy.
Woody keeps going. Buzz and Jessie exchange a concerned look.

Woody, canÕt you see IÕm 
threatening everyone? Go back to 

the closet!
WOODY
Yeah, I know, I know. ItÕs just-- 

IÕm worried about Bonnie. A toy 

should go with her to orientation.
Dolly ushers Woody back toward the closet.
DOLLY
DidnÕt you hear Dad? You'll get 

Bonnie in trouble.
WOODY
Yeah, but kindergarten is so 

different. It can be too much for a 

kid. Having a buddy with them to 

get through it can really help 

things. I remember with Andy I 

would go to school with him--
DOLLY
--Uh huh. IÕm sorry, Woody, I hate 

to sound like a broken record but 

BonnieÕs not Andy.
WOODY
No, no, no, of course, I get that, 

but, if you would just hear me--
-- SLAM! Dolly closes the closet door on him.
DOLLY
(loud whisper)
Places everyone!
The toys drop.
INSIDE THE CLOSET

Woody SIGHS with resignation. HEARS BONNIE BURST BACK IN the 
room...
...Is she crying?

Woody searches through the slats. Finds Bonnie hiding under 
the bed, softly crying. Her parents enter.
14.

Bonnie, what are you doing back 
there? Come on we have to go.
Woody watches Bonnie with deep concern. Thinks...
IN THE ROOM

Bonnie wipes away a tear and gets up.
BONNIEÕS MOM
ThatÕs my big girl.
Dad takes her hand.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Come on. We gotta hurry, okay? 
DonÕt forget your backpack.
She grabs her backpack on the way out. Door closes.
The toys all jump to life. Dolly OPENS THE CLOSET...
DOLLY
Alright. Now what was it you were 
saying, Woody--?
Only the toddler toys stare back. No Woody.
DOLLY
Woody?
INT. BONNIEÕS FAMILY CAR - DRIVING - DAY
Bonnie stares out the window, uncharacteristically quiet. 
Next to her, on the seat, lies her BACKPACK. It ever-so- 

slightly UNZIPS itself to reveal...Woody.
BONNIEÕS MOM (O.S.)
Here we are.
EXT./INT. SCHOOL - DAY
Bonnie keeps close to her mom. They walk inside. FROM THE 
BACKPACK, Woody scopes out the surroundings as they enter
THE KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM

Woody observes Bonnie shrink back. Bury her face in her Mom.
15.

Bonnie honey, itÕll be okay.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER (O.S.)
Hi. Are you Bonnie?
Bonnie peeks up at the KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, bending down to 
talk to her.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER (CONT'D)
My name is Miss Wendy. IÕm going to 

be your kindergarten teacher.
(friendly whisper)
We have a special place where you 

can put your backpack. You want to 

see?
Reluctantly, Bonnie lets the teacher take her hand and lead 

her to a ROW OF CUBBIES. Both Woody and Bonnie take one last 

look back at Mom as she leaves.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER
Here we are Bonnie. Just for you.
Her backpack is hung in a cubby labeled with BonnieÕs name.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER
Okay class letÕs all find a seat at 

a table so we can start craft time.
Bonnie sits at the closest CRAFT TABLE.
ON WOODY

Through the OPEN ZIPPER, he watches Bonnie, sitting alone, 
quiet and anxious.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER (CONT'D)
On the first day of school, youÕll 

need a place to put your pencils. 

So, today weÕre going to make 

pencil holders. Now everyone take a 

cup and weÕll use the art supplies 

to decorate them.
Bonnie reaches for her CADDY OF SUPPLIES, when a LITTLE BOY 

EATING AN APPLE runs up to the table...
BONNIE
Hi.
...and steals the caddy from the table. 
16.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWoody GASPS with anger.
Bonnie sinks in her chair, on the verge of tears.

Woody glares at the Little Boy as the kid dumps his apple in 
a NEARBY TRASHCAN. It knocks SOME SUPPLIES into the can.
Woody thinks fast! Sneaks out of the backpack...makes his 
way, unseen, over to the trashcan...dives in. TOSSES CRAYONS 

from the trash at BonnieÕs feet. 
Bonnie notices. Leans down to pick up the crayons...

Woody then grabs an armful of STRAY TRASH (GLUE BOTTLE, 
POPSICLE STICKS, PENCILS, GOOGLEY-EYES, SPORK...) and dumps 

it all on her table before she sits back up.
Woody returns to the backpack, and watches with delight as 
Bonnie discovers the supplies. She smiles, and METHODICALLY 

BUILDS her new creation...
A PLASTIC SPORK WITH GOOGLY EYES.

Bonnie grins. Writes HER NAME on his feet. Shows it to the 
teacher.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER
Oh Bonnie. That is so clever.
BONNIE
Doo-do-de-doot. Hello, IÕm Forky. 

Nice to meet you!
Bonnie makes ForkyÕs pipe cleaner arm wave.
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER
Well hello Forky, itÕs nice to meet 

you! IÕm Miss Wendy.
Woody CHUCKLES. Job well done.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Bonnie and the other kids burst out of the classroom. She 
runs to her waiting Mom and Dad, waving Forky.
BONNIE
Mom! Dad! Look what I made! His 

name is Forky!
17.

Oh wow! Look at that!...That is so 
cool!
BONNIE
I finished kindergarten!
Mom and Dad share a look.
BONNIEÕS MOM
Um, no. That was just orientation.
BONNIEÕS DAD
But for being such a brave girl, we 

have a surprise for you.
BONNIE
What is it?!
INSIDE BONNIEÕS BACKPACK
Woody listens.
BONNIEÕS DAD (O.S.)
Since school doesnÕt start for 
another week, we are going on a 

road trip!
BONNIE (O.S.)
Can I bring Forky?
BONNIEÕS MOM (O.S.)
Of course you can!
BONNIE (O.S.)
Yay!
Woody smiles -- then ducks behind a notebook as BONNIE PLACES 

FORKY INSIDE. Zip. Woody admires his handiwork:
WOODY
And they said I shouldn't go to 

school with Bonnie. We've got this 

kindergarten thing under control 

eh?
(laughs to self)
I can't believe I'm talking to a 

spork.
One of ForkyÕs GOOGLY EYES SETTLES. Woody freezes. Did I just 

see that? Moves in for a closer look...
-- FORKY TAKES IN A HUGE BREATH

19.

...But then something really weird 
happened...Bonnie made a friend in 

class.
DOLLY
Oh, sheÕs already making friends!
WOODY
No. She literally MADE a new 

friend.
(to the backpack; gently)
Hey...itÕs okay. Come on out. 

ThatÕs it. Come on, there you go...
From inside, the sound of NERVOUS WHIMPERS.
WOODY (CONT'D)
Come on, letÕs get you out of 

there. You got this. Good, Good.
Like a frightened baby fawn, the plastic spork squints into 

the sunlight. Woody takes him by his pipe cleaner hand. Helps 

him up on his popsicle stick feet.
WOODY 
Everyone, I want you to meet... 

Forky!
SLINKY DOG/JESSIE/MR. POTATO HEAD/REX
Golly...Bob...Howdy.../ Wow! / Look 

at that! / Look how long his arms 

are!
Forky stares back at all the toys, like a lost child.
FORKY
Trash?
WOODY
No...ÒTOYSÓ. TheyÕre all toys.
FORKY
T-t-to--trash.
Woody indicates BonnieÕs WASTEBASKET.
WOODY
No, no, no-- THATÕS the trash. 

These are your friends!
BONNIEÕS TOYS
Hi!
20.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARSTARTLED, Forky falls over.
FORKY
Trash!
WOODY
Shhh, no no, itÕs okay...
Forky tries to make a run for the wastebasket, REPEATING THE 
WORD ÒTRASHÓ. Woody constantly returning him to the group as 

the toys question him:
TRIXIE
Woody, I have a question. Um, well 

actually, not just one, I have all 

of them. I have all the questions.
BUTTERCUP
Uh... why does he want to go to the 

trash?
WOODY
Because he was made from trash. 

Look, I know this is a little 

strange, but you gotta trust me on 

this - Forky is THE most important 

toy to Bonnie right now.
MR. PRICKLEPANTS
Important? HeÕs a spork!
Woody holds squirming Forky as he reattaches a stray eye.
WOODY
Yes, yeah, I know, but this spork - 

this toy - is crucial to Bonnie 

getting adjusted to kindergarten.
DOLLY
Woody, arenÕt you being a little 

dramatic about all this?
WOODY
I know this is new to everybody, 

but you should see how much this 

little guy means to Bonnie.
(sets Forky down)
When she started playing with him, 

she had the biggest smile on her 

face, I wish you could have seen 

it.
(walks up to the toys)
(MORE)21.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBonnie was really upset, and I 
swear, once she made Forky it was a  

complete transformation.
JESSIE
Uh, Woody...?
WOODY
Just a second Jessie. So we all 

have to make sure nothing happens 

to him.
JESSIE
Something happened to him.
Jessie points to FORKY JUMPING INTO THE WASTEBASKET WITH 

GLEE.
WOODY
Chutes and Ladders.
Woody leaps in after him. The gang just watches with 

fascination as he struggles to pull Forky out:
WOODY
Well I guess IÕll...just 

babysit him until heÕs used 

to the room.
FORKY
(struggles)
Trash!...Trash!...
-- BONNIE ENTERS!
The toys all drop just in time. Bonnie climbs on her bed.  
Searches through her backpack...
BONNIE
Forky? Where are you, Forky?
Behind her, Forky is suddenly LAUNCHED out of the wastebasket 

and onto the bed. Bonnie turns.
BONNIE
There you are! I thought IÕd lost 

you, silly.
She returns to her backpack -- FORKY JUMPS BACK into the 

wastebasket...is thrown back up...THIS REPEATS...
DISSOLVE TO:

up on the bed himself to put Forky back on the pillow...
FORKY
No, no, no...Big girl scary!

Bonnie rolls over in her sleep, and PULLS WOODY CLOSE TO HER. 

Woody (still holding Forky) smiles with bliss...and relaxes 

into BonnieÕs embrace. A feeling heÕd nearly forgotten.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BONNIEÕS ROOM - MORNING
Woody wakes. BonnieÕs still asleep, but Forky is gone
! In a 
panic, Woody crawls to the edge of the bed.
WOODY
(loud whisper)
Forky?!
BELOW, INSIDE THE WASTEBASKET

Forky sleeps like a baby, nestled in the trash. Woody SIGHS 
WITH RELIEF. Goes to fish him out --
BONNIEÕS DAD (O.S.)
Bonnie!
Woody is forced to go limp. Tumbles off the side. Hits the 

wastebasket. Forky spills out onto the floor. DAD ENTERS.
BONNIEÕS DAD (CONT'D)
LetÕs go! Rise and shine!
Dad STEPS ON WOODY as walks to the bed. Bonnie stirs awake. 
BONNIEÕS DAD
Who wants to go on a road trip?
23.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBONNIE
Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly, and 
Buttercup, and Forky, and...
(looks around)
Forky? Where are you?
BONNIEÕS DAD
HeÕs gotta be here somewhere...
BELOW, Woody tosses Forky up on the bed. Bonnie finds him. 

Hugs Forky tight:
BONNIE
Forky!
BONNIEÕS DAD
Come on. LetÕs eat some breakfast 

and hit the road!
BONNIE
LetÕs go Forky!
Again, Dad steps on Woody's head as they exit. Door shuts.
Woody sits up. Rubber head caved in, woozy. Buzz steps up.
BUZZ
Whoa. HeÕs quite a handful Woody. 
You need help with him on the road 

trip?
WOODY
No. No, no. I got it, I got it.
Woody gets to his feet. Holds his nose and blows -- his head 

POPS back into shape.
WOODY
We'll just be stuck in an RV, he 

can't get far. I got this! I got 

it.
EXT./INT. RV TRAILER - VARIOUS LOCATIONS
As the family travels West, A SHORT SERIES OF MOMENTS play of 
Bonnie playing with Forky and her toys. At every chance, 

Forky tries to throw himself away, and Woody is forced to 

save him. All to the RANDY NEWMAN SONG: ÒI CANÕT LET YOU 
THROW YOURSELF AWAY.Ó
24.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXAREXT. RV - LATE NIGHT
The RV driving down a wooded highway. Passes a HIGHWAY 
DIRECTION SIGN FOR ÒGRAND BASINÓ.
INT. RV TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
Bonnie sleeps, buckled up at the kitchen table. Holds a 
frustrated Forky tightly in her hand. 
ON WOODY

He lies slumped on the floor, keeping his tired eyes trained 
on Forky. Buzz sneaks his way over.
BUZZ
Hey Buddy.
WOODY
Hey, Buzz.
Buzz sits down beside his old friend.
BUZZ
You doing okay?
WOODY
I donÕt know, Buzz, I know you 

werenÕt around when Andy was little 

but...I donÕt remember it being 

this hard...
They glance up at Bonnie as she stirs in her sleep.
BUZZ
Want me to take next watch? I'll 

keep an eye on Forky.
WOODY
No, no. I need to do this. That 

little voice inside me would never 

leave me alone if I gave up.
BUZZ
Hmmm... Who do you think it is?
WOODY
Who?
BUZZ
The voice inside of you. Who do you 

think it is?
25.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Uh. Me? You know, my conscience?
(off BuzzÕs puzzled look)
The part of you that...tells you 
things? What youÕre really 

thinking?
Buzz considers this.
BUZZ
Fascinating. So your inner voice... 

advises you.
Buzz taps WoodyÕs PULL STRING RING...then ponders his own 

VOICE COMMAND BUTTON. Presses it --
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒITÕS A SECRET MISSION IN UNCHARTED 

SPACE. LETÕS GO!Ó
Woody jumps on Buzz to quiet him. They glance up at Bonnie -- 

still sleeping. PHEW -- Wait. BonnieÕs HAND IS EMPTY! 
BUZZ
WhereÕs Forky?
Frantically, they scan the room. Find Forky on the REAR 

BED...waddling towards the OPEN REAR WINDOW!
WOODY
Oh no! Forky! Forky!
FORKY
I am not a toy! IÕm a spork! I was 

made for soup, salad, maybe chili, 

and then the trash. IÕm litter.
Forky jumps out the window!!
FORKY (CONT'D)
Freedom!
Woody freaks! Now all the other toys are up. Everyone forced 

to SPEAK IN WHISPERS:
WOODY
Hamm, how far to our next stop?
Hamm peeks up front at GPS DISPLAY SCREEN.
HAMM
5.32 miles, give or take.
26.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
I can make that. IÕll meet you at 
the RV park.
BUZZ
Woody hold on a minute--
Too late. Woody is already climbing out the window...
OUTSIDE THE RV

Woody swings down to the REAR BUMPER. Stares down at the 
ROARING HIGHWAY. This is crazy.
Before he can commit to jumping, the RV HITS A POTHOLE. Woody 
goes tumbling to the ground. Hard.
WOODYÕS UPSIDE-DOWN POV on the RV lights shrinking. 

He gets up. Dusts himself off. Straightens his hat...
WOODY
(calls out)
Forky!
...and starts walking.
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Woody walks down the dark, empty road.
WOODY
Forky, where are you?
Woody stops. Hears a STRUGGLE in the grass. Finds Forky stuck 
with his prongs embedded in the dirt.
EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER
Woody is now dragging Forky by his pipe cleaner hand.
FORKY
Carry me?
WOODY
No.
FORKY
Why do I have to be a toy?
27.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Because you have BonnieÕs name 
written on the bottom of your 

sticks.
FORKY
Why do I have Bonnie's name written 

on the bottom of my sticks?
WOODY
Because she--
(tries a new tactic)
Look, she plays with you all the 

time. Right?
FORKY
Uh, yes.
WOODY
And who does she sleep with every 

night?
FORKY
The big white fluffy thing?
WOODY
No, not her pillow - you.
(considers)
Alright, Forky. You have to 

understand how lucky you are right 

now. YouÕre BonnieÕs toy. You are 

going to help create happy memories 

that will last for the rest of her 

life.
Woody stops to see if this is getting through to him. Nope. 

ForkyÕs been distracted by the existence of his own hand.
FORKY
Huh? What?
Woody is furious. Turns away to calm himself:
WOODY
Okay, doing it for Bonnie...Doing 

this for Bonnie...IÕm doing it for 

Bonnie...
(turns back to Forky)
Okay, like it or not, you are a 

toy. Maybe you donÕt like being one 

but you are one nonetheless. Which 

means you are going to be there for 

Andy, when he--
28.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
WhoÕs Andy?
WOODY
--I mean, Bonnie! You have to be 
there for Bonnie. That is your job.
He takes up ForkyÕs hand. They start walking again.
FORKY
Then whatÕs your job?
WOODY
Right now itÕs to make sure you do 

yours.
FORKY
Carry me?
WOODY
No!
They walk in silence for a beat.
FORKY
WhoÕs Andy?
WOODY
...Andy was my other kid.
FORKY
You had another kid?
WOODY
Yeah. For a long time. And it was 

pretty great...I was a favorite toy 

actually. Running the room was my 

job. Keeping all the toys in 

place...
DISSOLVE - LATER IN THE WALK
FORKY
So... he thought AndyÕs room was a 

planet? Wow, that is messed up.
WOODY
Right! ThatÕs exactly what I 

thought when he first showed up.
FORKY
I mean, how is that NOT annoying.
29.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Thank you!
ANOTHER DISSOLVE - EVEN LATER (SUNRISE)
Woody now carries Forky in his arms.
WOODY
...Well then you watch Ôem grow up, 
become a full person...and then 

they leave. They go off and do 

things youÕll never see - DonÕt get 

me wrong you still feel good about 

it - but then somehow you find 

yourself after all those years, 

sitting in a closet just feeling...
FORKY
Useless?
WOODY
Yeah.
FORKY
Your purpose fulfilled.
WOODY
Exactly.
FORKY
Woody, I know what your problem is.
WOODY
You do?
FORKY
YouÕre just like me. Trash!
WOODY
What is it with you and trash?
FORKY
ItÕs warm...ItÕs cozy...
WOODY
Ew...I guess...
FORKY (CONT'D)
...and safe. Like somebodyÕs 

whispering in your ear -- 

everythingÕs going to be okay.
WOODY
Forky! ThatÕs it! ThatÕs how Bonnie 

feels when sheÕs with YOU.
30.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
She does?
WOODY
YES!
FORKY
Wait a sec--
Forky thinks. Jumps out of WoodyÕs arms and faces him.
FORKY
You mean she thinks IÕm 
warm...?
(beat)
...and cozy...?
(beat)
...and sometimes kinda 

squishy?
WOODY
(following along)
Yep.
(beat)
Uh-huh.
(beat)
Mmmm...that too. Yes.
ForkyÕs entire body trembles with epiphany. He GASPS.
FORKY
I get it now. IÕm BonnieÕs trash.
WOODY
Yes! -- Wait, what?
FORKY
I AM BonnieÕs trash!
WOODY
No, no, no, not exactly...
FORKY
Oh, she must be feeling awful 

without me. Woody, we got to get 

going, she needs me!
Forky breaks away, running ahead towards the LIGHTS OF THE 

TOWN OF GRAND BASIN.
FORKY (CONT'D)
Bonnie! IÕm coming!
WOODY
Whoa whoa! Forky slow down! Forky!
Woody runs to catch up.
31.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXAREXT. GRAND BASIN - MAIN STREET - DAWN
A quaint turn-of-the-century, roadside town. Made up of a few 
streets. Only one of everything. A banner over the street 

advertises ÒCARNIVAL DAYSÓ. The entire town still asleep. 

Nothing moves, except...
TWO SMALL TOYS

Woody and Forky skirt cautiously along the empty street, 
trying to stay hidden. Woody spies the illuminated ÒRV PARKÓ 

SIGN, poking above the one-story buildings, one street over.
WOODY
Forky, look. BonnieÕs right over 

there.
FORKY
Hurry!
Forky starts running towards the RV park. Woody is right 

behind him -- then stops short. POINTS OF LIGHT dot the 

ground at his feet? He looks up at a STOREFRONT WINDOW to 

see...
BO PEEPÕS LAMP

Like out of a dream, it GLOWS on display amongst ANTIQUES. 
What the...? Woody walks towards it, like a mirage.
Forky realizes Woody isnÕt with him. Returns.
FORKY
Woody?
WOODY
Bo...?
Woody gets a good look at the lamp. Yep, itÕs hers. Glances 
back at the RV park sign. Makes a decision...and heads for 

the STOREÕS FRONT DOOR.
FORKY
Woody? ArenÕt we - arenÕt we going 

to Bonnie?
Woody peers into the dark store. Assesses the locked door.
WOODY
I know, I know, but my friend might 

be in there.
32.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
Friend?
WOODY
Uh? A friend...Well a friend is 
like you and me.
FORKY
Trash?
WOODY
Tra--like...yes. And IÕm very 

worried that she might be lost.
FORKY
But Woody, BonnieÕs right there.
WOODY
Yeah, weÕll have you back before 

she wakes up. Come on.
Clutching Forky, Woody climbs through the FRONT DOOR MAIL 

SLOT. The name of the store reads: SECOND CHANCE ANTIQUES.
INT. ANTIQUE STORE - CONTINUOUS
The two toys stand in the midst of an OVERWHELMING COLLECTION 
OF ANTIQUES. To them, itÕs a small city, the mis-matched 

cabinetry are like skyscrapers, the aisles avenues, but itÕs 

chaotic - a virtual maze. It feels more like a spooky museum.
VARIOUS SHOTS of Woody and Forky wandering the store. Every 
time Woody calls out, Forky mimics him:
WOODY
Bo?
FORKY
Bo?
Nothing. The store is dead. Forky starts to play with the 

word ÒBoÓ. Bored.
FORKY 
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo! - Can we go back 

to Bonnie now? I don't see your 

friend.
Woody canÕt hide his disappointment.
33.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Yeah okay... sheÕs not in here. 
Come on, letÕs go.
The sound of SQUEAKY WHEELS... ItÕs coming towards them! 

Woody pulls Forky behind some FLOOR-LEVEL KNICK-KNACKS. They 

watch as AROUND THE CORNER appears...
...A BABY DOLL CARRIAGE.

And itÕs being walked by a VENTRILOQUIST DUMMY?! No emotions. 
Just a slow, mindless stroll.
FORKY
Is that Bo?
-- The dummy stops. Its head snaps unnaturally far over its 

shoulder, and STARES STRAIGHT AT THEM.
Caught, Woody steps out. All casual.
WOODY
Uh... Hey, Howdy, hey there. Sorry 

to bother you, um, but--
VOICE (O.S.)
(happy chuckle)
Why youÕre not a bother at all.
A BABY DOLL (GABBY GABBY) sits up in the carriage. Smiles.
GABBY GABBY
We were just out for my early 

morning stroll - and look -
(happy laugh)
- We met you! My name is Gabby 

Gabby. And this is my very good 

friend Benson.
BensonÕs hinged jaw opens for a creepy dummy smile.
WOODY
Woody. Pleasure to meet you.
GABBY GABBY
Well itÕs nice to meet you Woody. 

And you are...?
WOODY
This is Forky.
FORKY
IÕm trash.
34.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Ah -- our kid made him.
GABBY GABBY
Kid? Toys around here donÕt have 
kids. Are you two lost?
WOODY
Lost? No, no, but we are looking 

for a lost toy. 
As Woody speaks, Gabby locks in on WOODYÕS PULL-STRING 

reflected in a silver tray behind him.
WOODY (CONT'D)
She's a figurine? Used to be on 

that lamp in the window? Name's Bo 

Peep?
GABBY GABBY
Bo Peep?! Oh. Yes. I know Bo.
WOODY
You do?
GABBY GABBY
Hop on in. WeÕll take you to her.
WOODY
Oh, um, you don't have to do that--
Before they can decide, the dummy grabs them. Drops them in 

the carriage, opposite Gabby.
WOODY (CONT'D)
Ah, well. Okay.
GABBY GABBY
Benson, be careful with our new 

friends.
AS THEY STROLL THE STORE:
FORKY
Wow, what service.
WOODY
(uncomfortable)
Uh. Thank you for your help, I 

haven't seen Bo in years--
GABBY GABBY
May I ask, when were you made?
35.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Me? Oh, IÕm not sure. Late fifties?
GABBY GABBY
Me too! Gee, I wonder if we were 
made in the same factory. WouldnÕt 

that be something? I gotta say, you 

are in great condition.
WOODY
Well...I try to stay active.
GABBY GABBY
And look at that, you have a 

voicebox like me. Benson, show him.
WOODY
Oh, thatÕs really not necessary...
Benson stops the carriage. REMOVES GABBYÕS VOICEBOX from her 

back. Pulls the string:
GABBY GABBY VOICEBOX
(distorted)
ÒIÕM GABBY GABBY AND I LOVE YOU!Ó
FORKY
Wow, you need to fix that.
GABBY GABBY
My record works just fine. ItÕs the 

voicebox thatÕs broken. Does yours 

still work?
Before Woody can answer, Benson pulls his string.
WOODY
Hey-- !
(WOODYÕS VOICEBOX)
ÒTHEREÕS A SNAKE IN MY BOOT!Ó
GABBY GABBY
Listen to that! Let's see it. I bet 

itÕs the same type.
WOODY
No-No thanks, mine's sewn inside. 

Is Bo around here? Because we need--
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK STRIKES 8 oÕclock.
36.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARGABBY GABBY
Oh! The store is about to open. 
DonÕt worry, weÕll take you where 

no one will see us.
WOODY
Oh, no. We canÕt stay.
GABBY GABBY
(giggles)
Yes, you can!
On cue, THREE MORE DUMMIES emerge from the shadows. Surround 

the carriage and escort it further down the aisle towards the 

back. A terrified Woody WHISPERS TO FORKY:
WOODY
We gotta go.
GABBY GABBY
You canÕt leave yet! You have what 

I need.
(points to WoodyÕs chest)
Right...inside...there.
The front door CHIMES. Gabby looks across the store as the 

STORE OWNER (MARGARET) ENTERS. Joined by her DAUGHTER (CAROL) 

and GRANDDAUGHTER (HARMONY). They CASUALLY CHAT.
GabbyÕs eyes light up.
GABBY GABBY
Harmony!
Woody grabs Forky and jumps! Hits the ground -- only has 
ForkyÕs pipe cleaner arm
. Shoot!
GABBY GABBY
(to dummies; polite)
Stop him please.
FORKY
Woody!
A dummy lunges for Woody. Snatches back ForkyÕs stray arm 
instead. Woody is forced to run as the dummies give chase. He 

rounds the corner -- sees Harmony in the aisle! GOES LIMP and 

PULLS HIS STRING:
WOODY VOICEBOX
ÒIÕD LIKE TO JOIN YOUR POSSE BOYS, 

BUT FIRST IÕM GONNA SING A LITTLE 

SONG.Ó
37.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARHarmony turns to find a Woody doll on the floor. No sign of 
the dummies.
AT THE FRONT DESK

Harmony runs up to Margaret. Shows her Woody.
HARMONY
Grandma, look what I found. Can I 
take it to the park?
MARGARET
Sure.
CAROL
Mom, she has enough toys from the 

store.
MARGARET
Oh itÕs fine. Nobody buys the toys 

anyway.
HARMONY
Thanks, Grandma!
OUTSIDE THE STORE
Harmony and Carol exit.
HARMONY
Mom, can we go to the carnival?
CAROL
We're going to the park. Maybe 
later, sweetie.
Woody watches from over Harmony's shoulder as BENSON RISES IN 

THE STORE WINDOW, one wooden hand clamped over ForkyÕs mouth.
EXT. RV PARK - MORNING
The RV is set-up. Awning open. Mom and Dad sit outside having 
their morning coffee. Birds chirp.
INSIDE THE TRAILER

Bonnie lies asleep. Buzz, Jessie and the other toys are all 
bunched at the foot of her bed, staring at her.
JESSIE
Maybe we should have gone with a 

fork.
38.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBUZZ
The spoon is safer.
We now notice that Bonnie sleeps with a SPOON in her hand. 
The toys watch as her eyes flutter open...she sits up...and 

looks straight away at the spoon she is holding.
BONNIE
Forky? WhereÕs Forky?! Mom! Dad!
Searches. Becoming more panicked. Mom and Dad rush in.
BONNIEÕS DAD
WhatÕs wrong honey?
BONNIEÕS MOM
Are you okay?
BONNIE
I canÕt find Forky! HeÕs missing!
BONNIEÕS MOM
Bonnie, itÕll be alright. IÕm sure 

heÕs here somewhere.
Buzz and Jessie exchange a worried look. Mom comforts a 

crying Bonnie as Dad searches.
BONNIEÕS MOM
You know if we donÕt find him, you 

can make a new one...
BONNIE
No. There's only one Forky.
BONNIE'S DAD
Uh...letÕs go look outside, maybe 

he...he fell on the ground 

somewhere...?
They exit the RV.
ON THE BED, the toys jump back to life. Watch out the REAR 
WINDOW, as Bonnie and her parents continue to search.
DOLLY
Aw. Poor Bonnie.
BUZZ
Woody was right. We all should have 

been safeguarding the utensil.
TRIXIE
Why isnÕt Woody back yet?
39.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARREX
Oh, do you think heÕs lost?!
BUTTERCUP
Buzz, what do we do?
TRIXIE
What do we do, Buzz?
BuzzÕs STAMMERS to come up with an answer as Trixie gets in 
his face:
TRIXIE
...Buzz, what do we 

do?...What do we do, 

Buzz?...What do we do 

Buzz?...Buzz--Buzz-- !
BUZZ
Uh...Oh, uh...Uh...
REX
What would Woody do?
HAMM
Jump out of a moving vehicle.
BUZZ
(to himself)
What would Woody do?
While the TOYS PANIC, Buzz thinks. Looks down to his chest. 

Turns away, and PRESSES HIS VOICE COMMAND BUTTON:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒITÕS A SECRET MISSION IN UNCHARTED 

SPACE. LETÕS GO!Ó
Buzz turns back to the toys. Interrupts.
BUZZ
--I think... I have... to go.
REX/SLINKY/TRIXIE/POTATO HEAD
Where?!...Where you goinÕ? 

Why?...Should we all go? Are we 

going?...And then what?!
Buzz doesnÕt have an answer. Presses his button again:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒNO TIME TO EXPLAIN! ATTACK!Ó
BUZZ
No time to explain!

©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBuzz DIVES OUT THE WINDOW. The TOYS ALL GASP.
JESSIE
Buzz!
DOLLY
Okay. What is with everyone jumping 
out the window?
EXT. RV PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buzz races across the RV park grounds, keeping low. He leaps 
over the legs of a picnic table, through a fence and onto... 
THE EDGE OF THE TOWNÕS CARNIVAL GROUNDS

Buzz ducks behind a TRASHCAN. Stops to think.
BUZZ
Woody and Forky were last seen on 
the highway...but where is the 

highway?
Presses his voice button:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒTHE SLINGSHOT MANEUVER IS ALL 

WEÕVE GOT! FULL SPEED AHEAD!Ó
He looks up. AN ÒOCTOPUS RIDEÓ spins and dips right in front 

of him.
BUZZ
Thanks, inner voice!
Buzz charges under the rideÕs barricade. Grabs onto the 

BOTTOM OF A SPINNING CAR. It lifts him high into the air, 

where he can now see...
BUZZ
The highway! On my way, Woody!
Buzz lets go. His WINGS POP OUT as the momentum of the ride 

sling-shots him in a high arc...
...straight at a SALAD SPINNER RIDE! -- Buzz rebounds off the 
ride...
...off a BOUNCY HOUSE...

...then an UMBRELLA...
41.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXAR...and SLAMS into a PORT-O-POTTY...
...but still manages to land in a crouch on the grass. Phew! 
He stands -- WHAM! -- the PORT-O-POTTY DOOR opens, knocking 

Buzz over. A CARNIE steps out. Picks up the Buzz doll.
STAR ADVENTURER CARNIE
Rad.
ON GAME BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
The carnie zip-ties Buzz to a WALL OF PRIZES.
STAR ADVENTURER CARNIE
(bored)
Step right up, put your money down, 
get yourself a real Buzz Lightyear, 

hey, hey...
PULL BACK to show kids crowding around the booth, eager for a 

chance to win a real Buzz Lightyear.
EXT. LOCAL PARK/PLAYGROUND - DAY
LOW ANGLE on blue sky. Lifeless Woody rises into frame in a 
baby swing. Harmony pushing him. Carol calls from a table:
CAROL
Harmony, honey! Sunscreen!
HARMONY
Okaaaaay!
(to Woody)
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.
The second heÕs alone, Woody scrambles for cover behind a 

play structure post.
WOODY
(to himself)
Okay, antique store...
Spots the FERRIS WHEEL above the distant trees.
WOODY (CONT'D)
Oh! That way!
He starts in that direction -- A BUS OF SUMMER CAMP KIDS 

pulls up. Blocks his way. Woody retreats...
INTO A SANDBOX
42.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARA CUPCAKE TOY pops out of the sand, startling Woody.
CUPCAKE TOY
Did you seeÕem? How many are there?
Woody ducks as a SKYDANCER DOLL helicopters in.
SKYDANCER DOLL
We got a busload of campers!
A COMBAT CARL, ICE ATTACK COMBAT CARL, AND VOLCANO ATTACK  
COMBAT CARL run in formation into the sandbox.
COMBAT CARLS
Hut. Hut. Hut. Here they come!
Everyone around Woody DROPS INTO TOY MODE. The sand 

rhythmically vibrates beneath his feet -- BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. 

Woody dives against the sandbox barrier for cover, just as...
...THE SUMMER KIDS JUMP IN! Woody watches them find the lost 
toys, picking them up and running around the playground.
Woody sneaks over to the slide. Has to drop into toy mode 
when a GIRL flies off it, leaving a SHARK IN A BOAT behind. 

The toy rows back up the slide...
SHARK IN A BOAT
Oh baby, itÕs a good day to play! 

Am I right?
Flummoxed, Woody searches for a way out, when -- he catches A 

GLIMPSE OF TOY SHEEP scurrying to the MERRY-GO-ROUND. Huh?!
Woody sneaks after them under the play structure, but FEET 
drop down in front of him! He goes limp. 
A LITTLE GIRL (LISA) smiles down at Woody...picks him 
up...holds him up to the toy in her other hand...
...BO PEEP

TIME SLOWS. Locked in toy mode, Woody and Bo silently face 
each other for the first time in nine years.
LISA
(as Bo Peep)
Hello, Mr. Cowboy. How are you 

today? Do you like riding horses?
Woody and Bo are brought closer together, when...
43.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFRIEND (O.S.)
Want to play on the swings?
Lisa sets them down. Runs off. Woody starts to get up...
WOODY
Bo?
-- but Bo pushes him back down as kids run by. Then, when the 
coast is clear, Bo pulls Woody to his feet.
BO
Come on.
She steps on the edge of a DISCARDED FRISBEE, flipping it 

onto its side. Hidden behind the rolling disc, she leads them 

through the busy playground and leaps --
INTO THE BUSHES

Woody tumbling in the dirt. Bo laughs and helps him up.
WOODY
Bo-?...Bo Peep?!
BO
Woody! I canÕt believe itÕs 
you! I never thought IÕd see 

you again!
She adjusts his hat. Just like the old days. Starts to dust 

him off. Woody mistakes it for a hug...opens his arms --

Awkward. Both flounder and look to the playground:
BO
So which kid is yours?
(beat)
None.
(beat)
YouÕre a lost toy?!
(beat)
ThatÕs great! -- Huh?
WOODY
Which one is yours?
(beat)
No one.
(beat)
Wait - YouÕre a lost toy?!
(beat)
ThatÕs awful...
WOODY (CONT'D)
...I mean awfully great! That you 

are lost...out here...
Suddenly -- A SKUNK! -- is charging right for them!
WOODY
Skunk.. Skunk! SKUNK!
BO
Watch out!
Woody falls to the ground. But Bo stops the skunk in its 

tracks with her crook. 
44.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
I told you not to drive so fast. 
You almost ran him over.
Bo FLIPS OPEN THE SKUNK! ItÕs a mocked up REMOTE CONTROL CAR. 

BOÕS SHEEP at the wheel. They tackle Woody, BLEATING with 

excitement.
WOODY
Well, hey guys! I missed you, too. 

If it isn't...Bobby? Gus? 

Uh...Lefty?!
The sheep hop off him. Take offense.
BO
Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
WOODY
Right! Sorry, guys.
BO
Girls.
WOODY
Girls! Of course!
They BAA, indignant. Bo pets them.
BO
Alright, alright.
(to Woody)
Okay. LetÕs get a look at you. You 

need any repairs?
WOODY
Repairs? No, IÕm fine.
Already scavenging, the sheep present Bo with a safety pin. 

She adds it to her COLLECTION OF REPAIR PARTS in the skunk.
BO
Hey! Nice find girls.
WOODY
WhereÕd you get all this stuff?
BO
Here and there. You know, some kids 

play rougher than others, so I try 

to be prepared.

How long have you been out on your 
own?
BO
Seven fantastic years!
WOODY
Seven?!
BO
You would not believe the things 

IÕve seen-- 
(the sheep bring her a 

bottle cap)
Uh, no.
Woody is still processing this, when -- Bo taps on a TOY 

POLICE BADGE CASE sitting in the skunk.
BO (CONT'D)
Gigs! Come on out, thereÕs someone 

IÕd like you to meet.
The badge flips open. OFFICER GIGGLE MCDIMPLES, a half-inch 

tall toy, sits inside a tiny police headquarters.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Yo! Be right down.
Giggle bounces down a tiny set of stairs, hops into her tiny 

car and drives across a tiny road to the front of the badge 

case. She bounces up to perch on BoÕs shoulder.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
WhatÕs the situation, we heading 

out of town or -- Whoa! WhoÕs this?
BO
You remember the rag doll I told 

you about?
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
The cowboy? No way!
Giggle laughs. Her eyes on Woody.
BO
DonÕt stare.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
IÕm totally staring.
46.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
Woody, this is Giggle McDimples.
WOODY
Oh, hi Giggle.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
(re: WoodyÕs BADGE)
Whoah. You didnÕt tell me he was a 
cop!
She bounces onto WoodyÕs shoulder.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Howdy sheriff. OFFICER Giggle 

McDimples. I run Pet Patrol for 

Mini-Opolis. Search and rescue. 

Ants, caterpillars, miniature 

poodles, spiders--
COMBAT CARLS (O.S.)
HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT!
The COMBAT CARLS emerge from the bushes. Stand at attention.
BO
Carl! Where you headed?
COMBAT CARL
Combat Carl just heard there's a 

birthday party at the playground on 

main street.
VOLCANO ATTACK COMBAT CARL
Rumor has it they've got two 

pinatas.
ICE ATTACK COMBAT CARL
That could be twenty to thirty 

kids.
Giggle and Bo high-five.
BO
Nice.
COMBAT CARL
Oh yeah! Combat CarlÕs gettinÕ 

played with.
Carl and VolcanoÕ high-five. IceÕ is left hanging.
47.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARCOMBAT CARL
You guys in?
BO
You bet! Woody, you are gonna love 
this.
WOODY
(to Carl)
Uh- no, I canÕt...sir. 
(to Bo)
Bo, I need to get back to my kid.
THE CARLS
What?!...You gotta kid?
Bo is thrown hearing this, but then quickly hides her shock.
WOODY
Yeah.
COMBAT CARL
Way to beat the odds, soldier.
Carl hi-fives Woody and then VolcanoÕ, and unintentionally 

leaves IceÕ hanging again.
COMBAT CARL
Meet you at the playground, Peep. 

Combat CarlsÕ got a piŒata party to 

crash. Alright, move out!
The Carls ÒHut! Hut!Ó into the bushes. Woody turns to Bo 

(Giggles back on her shoulder.)
BO
So... you're with a kid? It's not 

Andy is it?
WOODY
No, no, he went off to college. But 

he gave us to Bonnie, sheÕs this--
BO
You have a little girl?
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
No way.
WOODY
Yeah, itÕs why IÕm out here. Her 

other toy is trapped in this 

antique store--
48.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
Second Chance Antiques?
(shares a look w/ Giggle)
We know that store.
WOODY
ThatÕs great! If you know the 
store, you could really help me 

find him--
BO
No way. We wasted years there, just 

sitting on a shelf collecting dust.
WOODY
Oh Bo, thatÕs awful. But...I donÕt 

have a choice. I have to get that 

toy from Gabby.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Whoa, steer clear of that weirdo.
BO
If I were you, IÕd cut my losses 

and go home.
Bo starts packing up the ÒSkunkmobileÓ.
WOODY
But Bonnie needs him to get through 

kindergarten.
BO
Kids lose toys everyday. Bonnie 

will get over it.
WOODY
No, no - but, you see, Bonnie needs 

him just like Molly needed you!
Something passes over BoÕs face at the mention of MollyÕs 

name. The sheep rush over to Woody. BLEAT with anticipation.
WOODY
No. Sorry, girls. MollyÕs not here.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Molly? Bo, I didnÕt know you had a 

kid.
BO
Oh, it was a long time ago.
49.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Oh, BoÕs kid was something special. 
She was the cutest thing, but...so 

afraid of the dark.
BO
It was just a phase.
WOODY
Oh, you werenÕt there in the 

beginning. Hearing Molly cry each 

night broke every toyÕs heart. And 

then...Bo came into the room. Her 

lamp was the only thing that made 

Molly feel safe. Mom would let her 

keep Bo on all night.
The memory brings a small smile to Bo.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Ha! Who knew you were such a softy?
WOODY
And Molly would fall asleep with 

her hand resting on BoÕs feet--
Bo playfully throws a TOY STICKY RUBBER HAND at Woody.
BO
Okay, okay, I get it.
WOODY
Bo, my kid really needs this toy.  

Will you help me? For old timeÕs 

sake.
BO
Alright, alright.
WOODY
(hugs Bo)
Thank you, thank you!
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Alright, guess weÕre doing this. 

Lets ride!
They all pile into the Skunkmobile. Sheep at the controls.
BO
Second Chance Antiques, and step on 

it.

INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY
We close in on...

GABBYÕS DISPLAY CABINET

Gabby eyes her reflection in a handheld mirror as she applies 
dots of paint with a brush to freshen her freckles.
FORKY (O.S.)
(struggles)
Hey. Hey!...
Gabby looks at Benson, struggling with Forky out of view.
GABBY GABBY
Benson? Are we finished?
Benson steps back to reveal Forky with his arms reattached.
FORKY
...Oh, that feels great.
GABBY GABBY
Look at that! Good as new.
FORKY
Yeah. Thank you...uh...Benson.
Benson gives an unsettling smile. Forky a little freaked out.
FORKY
Um, so whenÕs Woody coming back?
GABBY GABBY
Like I said, soon. He wonÕt forget 

about you.
FORKY
How do you know?
GABBY GABBY
You have your childÕs name written 

on your feet...
(laughs)
...sticks. That makes you a very 

important toy.
FORKY
That's exactly what Woody says!
51.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARGABBY GABBY
Hmmm... Interesting...
The front door bell CHIMES.
HARMONY (O.S.)
Hi Grandma! WeÕre back!
GABBY GABBY
SheÕs back!
Gabby rushes to the cabinet glass. Forky joins her.
FORKY
Who is she?
GABBY GABBY
Harmony.
FORKY
Wait a second, she took Woody!
(gasp)
Did she lose him?
GABBY GABBY
No! My Harmony is perfect.
Gabby moves to get a better view of Harmony. The girl runs to 
her favorite area, pulls out a TEA SET, and begins to play. 

Gabby brightens.
GABBY GABBY
Forky, it's Tea time. ItÕs tea 

time!
FORKY
Woohoo! ...What is tea time?
GABBY GABBY
Oh -- I'll show you!
She picks up a SMALL STORYBOOK titled ÒGABBY GABBY, A VERY 

SPECIAL DAYÓ. Flips it open to an ILLUSTRATION of a Gabby 

doll and a little girl playing tea.
As Harmony reaches for her teacup, Gabby picks up her own. 
She matches HarmonyÕs every move, as if playing together.
GABBY GABBY
IÕve been practicing. How do I 

look?
Forky peers at the book illustration.
52.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
Uh...little higher.
Gabby raises the cup a higher...
FORKY
Stick out your pinky.
...sticks out her pinky.
FORKY
Nice.
Gabby lovingly gazes down to Harmony and takes a pretend sip.
CAROL (O.S.)
Harmony, sweetie! IÕm leaving! Come 
give me a hug!
HARMONY
Bye, Mom!
GabbyÕs smiles fades as she watches Harmony skip away. The 

longing for her little girl to return written all over her 

face. Her attention drifts back to the book.
Forky watches Gabby FLIP THROUGH THE PAGES: a girl pushing 
her doll on the swing...spinning the doll through 

sunflowers...hugging the doll close...then pulling on the 

pullstring. Gabby tenderly touches the page.
GABBY GABBY
When my voicebox is fixed, IÕll 

finally get my chance.
Forky places a comforting pipe cleaner hand on hers. A sweet 

moment between them.
Gabby closes the book. Pulls Forky on to her lap.
GABBY GABBY
Now, about our friend Woody. I want 
to know everything about him.
FORKY
Oh yeah, Woody. IÕve known that guy 

my whole life. Two days. Hey, did 

you know that Bonnie was not his 

first kid. He had this other kid, 

Andy...and you know what? I donÕt 

think heÕs ever gotten over him...
EXT. CARNIVAL - STAR ADVENTURER BOOTH - DAY
53.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARA kid shoots and loses. The carnie leans against the booth 
bored, headphones on, music blaring. As the kid leaves, Buzz 

comes to life, and wrestles with the zip-tie holding him to 

the prize wall.
BUNNY (O.S.)
Psst, Hey! Lightyear.
DUCKY (O.S.)
Hey -- up here, Astro-boy.
Buzz looks up. TWO PRIZE STUFFIES, DUCKY & BUNNY (hands sewn 

together in friendship), hang above him.
BUNNY
If you think you can just show up 

and take our top prize spot, youÕre 

wrong.
DUCKY
Dead wrong.
BUZZ
You donÕt understand. IÕm trying 

to...
DUCKY
--Cheat the system and get with a 

kid? Yeah, we know.
BUZZ
No, I need--
BUNNY
--A child to shower you with 

unconditional love? Join the club, 

pal.
DUCKY
Yeah, join the club.
BUZZ
CÕmon, help me get outta here.
DUCKY
IÕll help you...with MY FOOT!
Ducky kicks at him. Not even close. Frustrated, Ducky looks 

up to Bunny:
54.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARDUCKY
Bunny, what are you 
doing?...I canÕt reach him. 

Help me out here, 

cÕmon...WhatÕs not to 

understand?...YouÕre gonna 

make me say it?...With these 

tiny legs, I cannot reach 

without your help...
BUNNY
...Hmm?...Oh. Sorry, Ducky. 

IÕm not a mind reader, you 

know...Hmm?...What?...Oh. Uh-

huh. Well...
Buzz struggles to free himself as Ducky and Bunny squabble:
DUCKY (CONT'D)
...THIS is what IÕve been talking 

about Bunny, you need to work on 

paying attention and your listening 

skills...
DUCKYÕS FOOT suddenly makes contact with BuzzÕs head. Buzz 

SIGHS as the ineffectual padded foot keeps kicking him:
DUCKY
AHA! How you like THAT, cheater? 

Huh? P-SKWOW!
(Kick.)
Ha ha! To infinity and... MY FOOT!
(Kick.)
BOOM! In a galaxy far far away... 

you got kicked in the head. BOOM!
BUZZ
(to self)
How do I get out of here?
Then he remembers. Pushes his voice button:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒTHIS PLANET IS TOXIC. CLOSING 

HELMET TO CONSERVE OXYGEN.Ó
Buzz smirks. As Ducky swings in for another kick...
DUCKY
In the vacuum of space, they cannot 

hear you scREEEAM!
...Buzz SHUTS THE HELMET on his foot. Ducky SCREAMS in pain.
Ducky & Bunny pull hard, yanking Buzz out of the 
ziptie
. The 
weight of all three pulls them to the ground.

ON THE BOOTH FLOOR
55.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARDUCKY
So THATÕS what gravity feels like.
BUNNY
Yeah, thatÕs it.
Ducky & Bunny sit up to see Buzz... 
DUCKY
Hey, where you going?!
...LEAP OUT THE ELECTRICAL HATCH DOOR of the booth.
DUCKY
Hey, where you going?! You better 
get over here spaceman!
BUNNY
Put us back up there!
Ducky & Bunny follow after him through the flap -- but Bunny 

gets wedged. Ducky dangles from his hand, useless.
DUCKY
Bunny, what are you doing? 

HeÕs getting away, let's 

go!...Come on!
BUNNY
I'm trying!
EXT. CARNIVAL PARKING LOT - DAY
The Skunkmobile bursts from the bushes. Barrels towards the 
CARNIVAL.
INSIDE THE SKUNK
BO
Antique store, here we come!
WOODY
Bo, why do you ride around in a 
skunk?
OUTSIDE, the Skunkmobile WEAVES THROUGH THE FOOT TRAFFIC. 

Folks SCREAM at the sight of a skunk. Jump out of its way.
BACK INSIDE
WOODY
Oh, I get it. Smart.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Corndogs, corndogs, CORNDOGS!
56.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARThe Skunkmobile side-swipes a CORN DOG CARTÕS WHEEL. They go 
careening off course. Crashing --
UNDER THE CAROUSEL

All spill out. Bo lands on Woody. Glares at her sheep:
BO
Why are you so bad at driving? You 
got six eyes.
(pats Woody)
Thanks for the landing.
He chuckles, flustered. Bo offers to help Woody up.
BO
Come on, follow me--
He takes her hand -- POP! Her ARM COMES OFF in his hand.
Woody SCREAMS. Bo SCREAMS!!...Then starts laughing.
BO
IÕm fine! IÕm fine.
(re: WoodyÕs face)
DonÕt worry. Happens all the time. 
(calls out)
Tape!
Giggles tosses her a TAPE ROLL from the skunk. Bo catches it 
with her broken stump.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Not a bad hiding spot.
BO
(looks around)
Yeah! Leave the skunk, weÕll fix it 

later.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Ten-four.
BO
This will be more fun.
Bo hops up the RIDEÕS CENTER SPINDLE. Calls back to Woody:
BO (CONTÕD)
LetÕs get you to that store!
ON THE CAROUSELÕS CENTER SCENIC PANELS
57.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBo and Giggle have a brief moment to themselves as Bo tapes 
up her arm. They peek over the top edge.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Okay, spill it. The cowboy. WhatÕs 

the deal?
BO
ThereÕs no deal.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Uh huh...DonÕt do this to yourself, 

cowboyÕs got a kid.
BO
Giggle--
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Trust me, IÕve been there. You know 

about me and He-Man. IÕm not proud. 

Shh, here he comes!
Woody arrives. Giggle LAUGHS TOO LOUD to cover.
WOODY
What?
BO
Second Chance Antiques. Straight 

ahead.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Heavy foot traffic at the entrance.
BO
Easiest way in is...
BO (CONT'D)
The roof.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
The roof.
BO (CONT'D)
LetÕs go antiquing. Hold on!
Bo grabs the STICKY HAND, her STAFF...and Woody. Lassos the 

the UPPER FRAMEWORKS of the ride with the sticky hand, and 

sends them...
HIGH ABOVE THE CAROUSEL HORSES

Bo leads the way, racing along the steel struts...
58.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Bo, how did you end up here? I 
thought you were given to a new 

family.
Woody tries to keep up as Bo scales the CABLES to the roof.
BO
Oh you know how it goes. Their 

little girl grew up and didnÕt need 

me anymore so --
(raspberry)
WOODY
Oh, IÕm sorry, Bo...
BO
Eh, who needs a kidÕs room...
ATOP THE CAROUSEL, Bo and Woody emerge on the roof spire. 

Take in the breathtaking view. THRONGS OF KIDS below, playing 

at the carnival.
BO (CONT'D)
...when you can have all of this.
WoodyÕs gaze turns to Bo. He smiles. Giggle jumps on his 

shoulder.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Whatcha lookinÕ at Sheriff?
WOODY
What? Oh, uh, nothing. I was 

looking at -- the STORE. Right 

there. I was looking at the antique 

store.
Now Bo is smiling at Woody.
BO
Giggle. Count us down.
Bo spins her dress into a cape. Giggle COUNTS DOWN FROM Ò5Ó.
WOODY
Count down? For what?
BO
You want to get to the store, 

dontcha?!
Grabs WoodyÕs hand...
59.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARGIGGLE MCDIMPLES
...1!
...and jumps. Woody yells as they slide down the carousel 
roof...to the top of a bouncy castle...then off a pair of 

cafe umbrellas toward the store...
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
Buzz peeks out BEHIND A PLANTER by the antique store.
BUZZ
The highway exit has to be 
somewhere...where is it?
Presses his voice-command button:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒMETEOR SHOWER! LOOK OUT!Ó
Buzz obeys. Looks up just in time to catch WOODY, GIGGLE, BO 

& SHEEP LEAPING onto the ANTIQUE STORE AWNING.
BUZZ
Woody? Good work inner voice!
UP ON THE STORE ROOF
Bo leads the group up the roofÕs incline...
BO
So, how Ôbout you? HowÕs your new 
kid?
WOODY
Bonnie? Oh, sheÕs great. Jessie is 

loving it--
BO
JessieÕs still with you?
WOODY
Oh yeah, the whole gangÕs still 

together...well, I mean, most of 

us.
Bo glances back with a smile. She knows what he means.
BO
What about Rex?
60.

Yeah, yeah, Rex, Bullseye, Slinky, 
the Potato Heads...
BO
Buzz?
Unawares to Woody, Bo is looking past him at BUZZ JOGGING 

TOWARDS THEM on the roof.
WOODY
Yeah, Buzz too. I cannot wait to 

see his face when he hears that I 

found--
BUZZ
Bo Peep?!
Buzz and Bo hug.
BO
My old moving buddy!!
WOODY
Buzz?
BO
ItÕs so good to see you!
BUZZ
Woody, itÕs Bo Peep.
BUZZ
(to Bo)
What are you doing here?
WOODY
(to Buzz)
What are you doing here?
-- Ducky & Bunny suddenly SLAM into Buzz
!All three roll down the roof. Crash against the facade. Buzz 

pinned beneath the two stuffies.
BUNNY
Three years!
DUCKY
Three. Years.
BUNNY
ThatÕs how long weÕve been hanging 

up there waiting for a kid.
BUZZ
Look. IÕm sorry about that--
61.

You ruined our lives! Shame on you!
Woody and Bo catch up to them.
WOODY
Who are these guys?
DUCKY
Lightyear promised us a kid!
WOODY
You did what?
Buzz gets to his feet.
BUZZ
I did not.
They tackle him again, setting off BUZZÕS VOICEBOX.
WOODY
Alright, come on, stop it! 
Cut it out, now!
BO
CÕmon guys break it up.
Woody raises his boot. ShowÕs off BONNIEÕS NAME on the sole.
WOODY (CONT'D)
Guys, I have a kid!
Woody suddenly has their undivided attention.
DUCKY
You got a kid?
BUNNY
Like a KID kid?
DUCKY
Like a human kid, not a baby goat?
WOODY
Yeah. Now, let go of Buzz, and come 

with me. IÕll take you to Bonnie.

WhereÕs Forky?
WOODY
Long story...
DUCKY & BUNNY IMPROVISE A HAPPY SONG and dance as they follow 
the gang towards the CHIMNEY VENT.
INT. RV - DAY
ON BONNIEÕS TOYS bunched up on the rear bed. Sad eyes. They 
are all peering up at the FRONT OF THE RV...
Mom and Dad are CONSOLING BONNIE. SheÕs been crying awhile:
BONNIE
HeÕs not anywhere. ForkyÕs gone!
BONNIEÕS MOM
Oh honey, IÕm sorry.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Okay. LetÕs look outside one more 
time...but then we have to keep 

driving, ok?
As the family exits, the toys jump to life.
JESSIE
TheyÕre about to leave!
REX
The panic is attacking me...!
Rex paces. His tail knocking pieces off Potato Head. 
MR. POTATO HEAD
Hey! Watch it buddy!
MRS. POTATO HEAD
What do we DO?!
JESSIE
We have to stop them.
DOLLY
How?!

BUTTERCUP
We could frame Dad for a crime so 
he goes to jail...
REX
Or go back in time and warn Woody 

about the future...
TRIXIE
That's crazy. Time is a flat 

circle.
An idea hits Jessie. She runs and JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW!
REX
Ahh! Jessie!
UNDER THE RV
Jessie sneaks her way towards the front, while nearby Bonnie 
talks with her parents.
BONNIEÕS MOM
IÕm sorry Bonnie, we looked 

everywhere. But we need to get 

going now, okay?
BONNIE
Can we please leave a note for 

Forky so he knows where weÕre 

going? He has to go to 

kindergarten.
-- A sudden POP. A HISSING noise. Dad watches in horror as 

the RV slumps. Rushes to the front to discover...A FLAT TIRE.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Are you kidding me?! Just --

everythingÕs going perfectly. I-- 
(incoherent swearing)
BONNIEÕS MOM
Okay... DaddyÕs going to use some 

words. How about we go to the 

carnival? Or maybe check out some 

of those shops in town?
BACK INSIDE THE RV
Jessie crawls in through the back window. Joins the toys.

DOLLY
IÕm sure Buzz and Woody are on 
their way back right now.
INT. ANTIQUE STORE - RAFTERS - DAY
CLOSE ON THE CHIMNEY FAN. BoÕs crook pokes through the vent. 
Lifts it off. The gang look down into the store.
ItÕs enormous. Customers roam the aisles.
BUZZ
ForkyÕs in...there?
WOODY
Yeah.
BUNNY
Now hold on. I have a question. Who 
will Bonnie love more? Ducky or me? 

Say me.
DUCKY
No say Ducky...Ducky.
BUNNY
Bunny...Bunny.
BO
Okay guys. Playtime is over. You 

have to follow my lead. We stay  

together, we stay quiet. Are we 

clear?
WOODY
Absolutely. Lead the way.
The toys slide down the INNER TRUSSES of the roof. Bo 

silently takes the lead as they stick to the shadows.
ON THE FLOOR
65.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARThe toys drop into view. MOVE FAST down a NARROW ALLEYWAY 
between the cabinetry. Ducky & Bunny try to squeeze through:
DUCKY/BUNNY
Are you kidding me?...Move 

over...You move over...Quit push--
BoÕs sheep spin 180 to SHUSH them.
BUNNY
Oh my maker! That sheep has 

three heads!...All six eyes 

just looked into my soul.
DUCKY
Oh no no no no-- Gonna have 

nightmares.
Bo navigates a JUNGLE OF ELECTRICAL CORDS to the edge of an 

aisle. Points to a TOWERING GLASS DISPLAY CABINET. The 

centerpiece of the store.
BO
ThatÕs most likely where your Forky 

is being kept.
DUMMIES are propped atop the cabinet. Positioned to have a 

360 degree view of the store.
WOODY
Alright, this isnÕt so bad. We just 

canÕt be seen by the dummies.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Not just the dummies.
BO
Her cabinet is surrounded by a moat 

of exposed aisle.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Where Dragon roams.
Bo points to A STORE CAT (DRAGON), curled up on the floor. It 

gives a cute little meow, stretches...
BUZZ
We can handle a cat.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
No. Not this one.
...and gets up, revealing the SHREDDED BOTTOM HALF OF A PLUSH 

ZEBRA. Everyone GASPS in horror.
66.

Is that how we look...on the 
inside?
DUCKY
ThereÕs so much...f-f-fluff...
WOODY
So how do you propose we get up 

there?
Bo DRAWS A PATH IN THE AIR WITH HER STAFF from the top of a 

tall booth across the aisle to GabbyÕs cabinet. 
BO
We could go straight across.
WOODY
How?
BUZZ
ThatÕs quite a jump.
BO
We know the perfect toy to help.
-- The front door CHIMES. 
BONNIEÕS MOM (O.S.)
Oh Bonnie! Check it out. Look at 

all this cool stuff.
The gang all look to the FRONT DOOR -- Bonnie and her mom 
enter the store
!WOODY
Bonnie! WeÕve gotta get Forky now!
Woody darts out of hiding. Sprints for the cabinet.
BO
Woody, donÕt --
(to Giggle)
Stick to the plan!
Giggle hops to BuzzÕs shoulder as Bo chases after Woody.
GIGGLES MCDIMPLES
Follow me.
BUZZ
Roger that.
67.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARGiggle leads Buzz, Ducky & Bunny back down the alleyway.
ON WOODY

He climbs the cabinet up to its DOORKNOB...It wonÕt budge.

INSIDE THE CABINET

Up on the shelf, Forky brushes GabbyÕs hair.
GABBY GABBY
Woody just sits in the closet? With 
no play time?
FORKY
Yeah, he told me himself. HeÕs 

useless.
GABBY GABBY
ThatÕs awful.
OUTSIDE THE GLASS DOOR, Woody pops up behind them -- but BoÕs 

crook yanks him back down out of sight.
FORKY
Such pretty hair.
BELOW THE DISPLAY CABINET
Bo pulls Woody into the shadows. Covers his mouth.
BO
(hushed)
What are you doing?! You need to 
stick to the plan.
WOODY
But itÕs Bonnie. SheÕs right--
The door CHIMES again. They watch Bonnie and Mom exit.
WOODY (CONT'D)
...there.
BO
(grabs Woody)
Come on. Stay quiet. You better 

hope the dummies didnÕt see--
TWO DUMMIES hop down in front of them!!
68.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARThey lunge for Woody...Bo knocks one away with her staff. Her 
SHEEP BITE DOWN on the other dummyÕs butt (BENSON). WonÕt let 

go. Benson screams in silent pain.
The fight rolls them into the OPEN AISLE. A CUSTOMER suddenly  
turns in the direction of the noise to see...
...all the toys lying lifeless in the aisle.

All except Benson.

The dummy (w/ sheep still attached) made it behind the 
cabinetry. Bo is forced to watch Benson DISAPPEAR INTO THE 

SHADOWS.
Finally, the customer walks away. Bo jumps to life. Races 
after Benson.
BO
My sheep!
BEHIND THE MAZE OF CABINETRY
Livid, Bo searches in all directions. Woody trails behind.
BO
What did I say to you? I lead. You 
follow.
WOODY
Bo IÕm so sorry. Really -- Just 

tell me how to help.
BO
You really wanna help?
(spins around)
Then stay out of my way. IÕm 

getting my sheep back.
WOODY
What about the others?
BO
Giggle knows what to do.
Bo heads deeper into the maze, not waiting for Woody...
BACK AT GABBYÕS DISPLAY CABINET

Margaret unlocks its doors to show a customer an item.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES (O.S.)
ThereÕs our objective.
69.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFROM A CHINA CABINET ACROSS THE WAY, Giggle, Buzz, Ducky & 
Bunny observe her holding THE KEY. 
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES (CONT'D)
We have to get that key. ItÕs the 

only way inside the cabinet.
BUZZ
You canÕt be serious. How are we 

supposed to do that?
DUCKY
You know what, leave that to us.
BUNNY
We know exactly what to do.
MOMENTS LATER
Margaret wanders down the aisle. Notices the stuffed Ducky & 
Bunny posed on the shelf.
MARGARET
Awww, where did you two come from --
WHAM! Ducky & Bunny clamp onto her face, not letting go!!
DUCKY & BUNNY
The keys!...HandÕem over lady! The 

keys!...GiveÕem up!...Where are 

they?!...Give us the KEYS! --
CUT TO:
REALITY. The toys still hiding on the cabinet as before.
BUZZ
Well, weÕre NOT doing that.
DUCKY
Yeah, yeah I agree, too visible.
BUNNY
Good point. It's a good point. 

Something more subtle.
DUCKY
Ooo! What about ÒWinner, winner, 

chicken dinner?Ó
BUNNY
Yes.
70.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARREPLAY OF THE IMAGINARY PLAN
- Again, Margaret walks down the aisle. This time a BASEBALL 
rolls across her path. She investigates where it came from --
WHAM! Ducky & Bunny on her face again!
DUCKY & BUNNY
The keys!...HandÕem over lady! The 
keys!...GiveÕem up!...Where are 

they?!...Give us the KEYS! --
BACK TO REALITY
BUZZ
Uh... youÕre kidding.
BUNNY
Really? Okay, okay...You 

just...alright...well...OH!
(to Ducky)
What about the olÕ ÒPlush Rush?Ó
DUCKY
There you go!
ANOTHER IMAGINARY PLAN
- Margaret again walks down the aisle, turns toward the 
shelf, and...nothing. Takes the money from the cash register.
- BACKSEAT POV of Margaret driving home that night. She 
checks her rearview mirror. Nothing. 
GIGGLES MCDIMPLES (O.S.)
Ugh!
BACK TO REALITY
Giggle is impatient.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
WhereÕs this going?
 DUCKY
Shhh! DonÕt interrupt.
RETURN TO THE PLAN

- INSIDE OF MARGARETÕS REFRIGERATOR as she opens the door, 
pulls out a dish, and...nothing. Closes the door.
71.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXAR- Margaret relaxes in a BUBBLE BATH. Nurses a glass of wine, 
and...nothing happens.
- IN BED. Margaret snores. Slowly, Ducky & Bunny RISE OVER 
HER...CUT WIDE ON HER HOUSE: Her SCREAM echoes in the night.
BACK TO REALITY

Ducky & Bunny raise their eyebrows. Pretty good, right?
BUZZ
Not gonna happen. N. O.!
BUNNY
Okay, do you want the key or not?
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
What is wrong with you!
DUCKY
What is wrong with -- We just 
gave you three brilliant 

ideas--
BUNNY
ItÕs like, itÕs one thing to 

say no. ItÕs another to offer 

a reason--
As they continue to argue, Buzz stares hard at THE KEY IN 

MARGARETÕS HAND from across the way.
BUZZ
How do we get that key?
INT. GABBYÕS DISPLAY CABINET - ON THE SHELF - SAME
Benson whispers into GabbyÕs ear. Forky on her lap.
GABBY GABBY
YouÕre kidding! Really? WoodyÕs 
back?
FORKY
WoodyÕs back?!
GABBY GABBY
And youÕre sure itÕs Bo Peep whoÕs 

with him?
The dummy turns to reveal BOÕS SHEEP still biting down on his 

behind. Gabby giggles happily:
GABBY GABBY
Thank you Benson. Make sure the 

others are ready.
72.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBenson nods and discreetly exits the cabinet.
FORKY
WoodyÕs back! IÕm coming Bonnie!
Forky runs for the closing door -- SLAMS into the glass. 
Nonplussed, he sits up and peers eagerly out into the store.
FORKY
(to self)
Bonnie...
GABBY GABBY
First - we must prepare for his 

arrival.
FORKY
Prepare?
GABBY GABBY
Have you ever played hide and seek?
FORKY
No. But it sounds complicated.
GABBY GABBY
Oh, itÕs easy. IÕll teach you, 

okay?
Gabby takes his pipe cleaner hand. Leads him down the shelf.
FORKY
Okay!
GABBY GABBY
The first thing you do is one of us 

finds a place to hide.
OUTSIDE THE CABINET, THEIR VOICES FADE as we PAN DOWN...
FORKY (O.S.)
Scary!
GABBY GABBY (O.S.)
While the other one counts to ten 

and tries to...
...to THE ALLEY BEHIND HER CABINET, where a solemn Woody 

follows a fuming Bo.
Bo dashes out of hiding. Approaches an OLD PINBALL MACHINE. 
Clambers up floor items to its front. PUSHES THE COIN RETURN  

repeatedly - a secret code. Woody joins her.
73.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
What are we doing-- ?
BO
Shh! Just stand there. And be 
quiet. I'll do the talking.
The coin door opens. The sound of a ROWDY CROWD spills out. A 

WIND-UP TIN TOY (TINNY) peers out. Sees Bo, and grins.
BO
Hi Tinny!
Tinny SPEAKS IN SOUND EFFECTS from his one man band, 

accordion, horns and drum. He is very excited to see Bo.
BO 
Nice to see you, too.
(off TinnyÕs glance at 

Woody)
Yeah, heÕs with me.
Woody wants to say something, but keeps his mouth shut. Tinny 

gestures for them to follow...
INSIDE THE PINBALL GAME

The cramped space is filled with an odd assortment of VINTAGE 
TOYS from different eras. A party atmosphere. Tinny SQUEAKS:
BO
My friend? No, no, no. HeÕs my 

accessory. 
She tosses Woody her staff and cape. Follows Tinny into the 

crowd. They all HAIL BO like an old friend.
BO
Hey guys! Long time no see.
She eyes the TOP-HALF OF THE ZEBRA DOLL Dragon dismembered.
BO
Hey Doug, saw your better half at 

the front of the store.
DOUG
Yeah, you mess with the cat you get 

the claws, heh-heh!
Random toys COMMENT AND QUESTION BO as she proceeds, crowding 

Woody out. He gets BoÕs attention. PULLS HIS STRING:
74.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY VOICEBOX
ÒWE GOT TO GET THIS WAGON TRAIN A 
MOVINÕ.Ó
BO
Agreed...Cheater.
Bo taps a bent-over KAIJU TOY. It pops upright.
BO
Have you seen Duke?
KAIJU TOY
(mouth sparking)
He's in the back.
HARD CUT CLOSE UPS OF DUKE CABOOM on his STUNT CYCLE
. He 
rolls in like a bigger than life hero. Fingers smoothing his 

mustache. He smiles - TING!
DUKE CABOOM
Look who jumped forty school buses 

and landed back into my life.
Bo bends down to talk to him. REVEAL Duke is half her size.
BO
Hi Duke.
DUKE CABOOM
WhoÕs the cowboy?
BO
Duke meet Woody. Woody meet--
DUKE CABOOM
--Duke Caboom. CanadaÕs greatest 

stuntman.
Duke strikes stunt poses on his cycle. Woody is confused.
BO
HeÕs posing.
(to Duke)
Duke, Duke we need to--
DUKE CABOOM
Hold on. One more. Oh yeah!
(holds his last pose)
What brings you back Peep?
75.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
We need your help. Gabby Gabby has 
his toy and my sheep.
DUKE CABOOM
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff? Those 

are my girls...
Woody rolls his eyes.
DUKE CABOOM (CONT'D)
What were you doing getting tangled 

up with Gabby Gabby? You know 

better.
BO
Yeah. Some toy thought it would be 

a good idea to wander into the 

aisle.
DUKE CABOOM
That doesnÕt make any sense.
BO
It doesnÕt, does it.
DUKE CABOOM
Everybody knows the best route is 

behind the shelves.
BO
That would have been a better 

route, wouldnÕt it.
DUKE CABOOM
Wow, this toy sounds like a 

complete idiot.
BO
(looking at Woody)
He does.
Woody HUFFS. Duke looks to Woody.
DUKE CABOOM
Wait, are you that toy?
BO
So hereÕs the plan: We need to jump 

over the aisle to GabbyÕs cabinet. 

And YOU are the toy to do it.
76.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARDUKE CABOOM
No.
BO
Duke--
Duke turns his back and STARTS POSING AGAIN, rejecting Bo 
with each pose:
BO
Duke -- Duke -- Duke -- Duke -

- Duke -- Duke --
DUKE CABOOM
Nope...Nuh-uh...No 

way!...Pass...Negative... 

Rejected--
Woody canÕt stay quiet any longer.
WOODY
Please, Mr. Caboom, this is really 

important. My kid--
Bo GASPS and CLAMPS her hand over WoodyÕs mouth.
DUKE CABOOM
You have a kid?
BO
(nervous laughter)
Hey Duke, show us some more poses 

whaddaya say?
DUKE CABOOM
I had a kid...
BO
Oh no.
DUKE CABOOM
...Rejean.
DukeÕs mustache quivers with emotion.
DUKE CABOOM
Rejean was so excited when he got 

me after Christmas...
FLASHBACK - REJEANÕS HOUSE
REJEAN (10) sits on the floor by the Christmas tree. He holds 
Duke, smiling.
DUKE CABOOM (V.O.)
It was the happiest Boxing Day of 

my life...
77.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARSECONDS LATER - Rejean watches a TV COMMERCIAL where Duke 
lands perfectly.
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Duke Caboom, riding the amazing 

Caboom stunt cycle. CA-BOOOOOM!
Rejean beams at the real Duke Caboom toy in his hand.
DUKE CABOOM (V.O.)
I was ready to finally do what I 

was made to do.
...Revs up Duke. Sends him up his TOY RAMP...
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER
CA-BOOOOOM!
But Duke clatters to the floor far short of his plastic RING 

OF FIRE ACCESSORY. RejeanÕs face falls.
DUKE CABOOM (V.O.)
But when Rejean realized I couldnÕt 

jump as far as the toy in the 

commercial...
Rejean kicks the launcher over. Leaves the room...and Duke 

lying abandoned on the floor.
BACK TO THE PRESENT

Duke caught up in the moment.
DUKE CABOOM (CONT'D)
...ItÕs a commercial! ItÕs not 
real! Rejean threw me away! ItÕs 

not fair, why Rejean! WHY!
SOBBING, Duke collapses with his bike to the floor.
BO
Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke. That 

was a long time ago. Right now we 

need the only toy who can ÒcrashÓ 

us onto GabbyÕs cabinet.
WOODY
Crash?
DUKE CABOOM
-- Crash?
78.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
Any Duke Caboom toy can land, but 
you are the only one that can 

ÒcrashÓ the way you do.
DUKE CABOOM
I am?
BO
Yes! Forget Rejean. Forget your 

commercial. Be the Duke you are 

right now - the one who jumps and 

crashes.
Duke thinks.
DUKE CABOOM
Be who I am...right now.
Woody looks at Bo. Takes in her words of wisdom.
BO
WhoÕs the Canuck with all the luck?
DUKE CABOOM
Caboom?
BO
WhoÕs the greatest of the great 

white north?
DUKE CABOOM
Caboom!
ON WOODY admiring BoÕs ability to pump Duke up.
BO
WhoÕs the most spectacular 

daredevil Canada has ever seen?
DUKE CABOOM
Duke Caboom!
BO
Can you do the jump?
DUKE CABOOM
Yes I Canada!
Duke springs to his feet. Strikes TRIUMPHANT POSES. DoesnÕt 

stop. Bo smiles at Woody.
79.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
WeÕve got our ride.
WOODY
(pulls string: VOICEBOX)
ÒYEE-HA!Ó
Bo smirks. Suddenly -- Giggle jumps on her shoulder!
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Yo, Bo!
BO
Gigs! You made it!
Bo turns to find Buzz, Ducky & Bunny also there. Buzz holds 
up the key to GabbyÕs cabinet!
BO
Good work.
WOODY
HowÕd you get it?
FLASH BACK TO BUZZ AND OTHERS ON THE CHINA CABINET
Buzz thinking hard.
BUZZ
How do we get that key?
Margaret passes - the toys freeze! She SETS THE KEYS DOWN 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM, and walks away.
BACK TO THE PRESENT
BUNNY
It was hard.
BUZZ
Very difficult.
DUCKY
Barely made it out alive.
BUNNY
Yeah.
DUCKY
So, youÕre welcome.
BO
Okay. Let's do this.
80.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARINT. ANTIQUE STORE - LATE AFTERNOON
Hidden behind a floor display, Woody, Bo and the rest of the 
toy gang observe Margaret making a sale at the front counter.
BO
Good. That sale buys us some time.
Woody starts to move -- Bo holds him back. Indicates THE 

DUMMIES ATOP GABBYÕS CABINET. Waits for their rotating heads 

to turn away...
BO (CONT'D)
Wait for it...Alright, letÕs go!
The gang moves fast down the exposed aisle. Ducky & Bunny 

carrying DUKEÕS BIKE LAUNCHER.
Bo and Woody branch off. He fights to keep up with her 
acrobatics as she climbs up shelves to a FILM PROJECTOR. 
Bo and Woody unspool a REEL OF FILM to the TOYS BELOW. Attach 
the launcher. Start reversing the reels to raise it up...
WOODY
So how long were you in this store?
BO
I donÕt know...a couple years. I 

didnÕt want to sit on a shelf 

waiting for my life to happen. So I 

left.
WOODY
Wow...youÕve handled this lost toy 

life better than I could.
Launcher raised. Bo hooks it with her staff...
BO
Aw, Sheriff. YouÕre selling 

yourself short. I think youÕd make 

a great lost toy.
...The two work together, carrying it like a couch, ACROSS 

THE CABINETRY...
WOODY
You really donÕt think youÕll ever 

be in a kidÕs room again, huh?
81.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
Nope. And now with the carnival 
traveling through, itÕs our chance 

to hop a ride and leave town.
WOODY
YouÕre -- youÕre leaving?
BO
Sure am. You ever think about 

getting out there and seeing the 

world?
WOODY 
Without a kid...?
(chuckles)
...No. You canÕt teach this old toy 

new tricks.
BO
YouÕd be surprised...
Bo, in the lead, reaches THE TOP OF THE CABINET OPPOSITE 

GABBYÕS. Pulls Woody up to join her.
BO
So...How'd you end up in the store 

in the first place?
WOODY
Well, I...I saw your lamp in the 

window...and...I thought 

maybe...uh...maybe you were inside, 

and so I, uh...I...
Woody trails off. Realizes Bo is distracted. Follows her gaze 

to...
A SEA OF SPARKLING CRYSTAL CHANDELIERS

...hanging from the rafters. The light of the SETTING SUN 
sparkles through them all. A truly magical moment.
WOODY
Wow. Will you look at that.
BO
Yeah. This is the only part of the 

store I ever liked.
Woody privately watches Bo take in all the beauty. None of it 

as beautiful as who he sees before his eye.
82.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO (CONT'D)
ThatÕs gonna be quite a jump for 
you and Duke.
He gives a loopy little laugh. The spell suddenly breaks.
WOODY
-- FOR ME!?
Woody looks back at the GAPING EXPANSE BETWEEN THEIR CABINET 

AND GABBY GABBYÕS...
BO
(pats him on the back)
DidnÕt I tell you? YouÕre going 

with him.
WOODY
I-I am?
MOMENTS LATER
DukeÕs bike locks into the launcher. Woody sits behind him on 
the tiny stunt cycle, YARN TIED AROUND HIS WAIST.
DUKE CABOOM
LetÕs Caboom!
Ducky & Bunny man the launcher controls. Buzz stands by, 

holding the yarnÕs spool.
BO
ItÕll be fine, DukeÕs the best.
WOODY
Yeah. At crashing!
ON GIGGLES
From A TALL SHELF, she monitors the Dummies. Dragon dozes on 
the floor. Waits for Margaret to pass through...
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
And... now!
She yanks the CHAIN OF A NEON SIGN. It blinks on. Signals Bo.
BO
Go!
The bike launches!
83.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWoody holds tight, terrified. Yarn unspooling fast from 
BuzzÕs grip. Duke focused on THE MAKESHIFT RAMP and GabbyÕs 

cabinet beyond it. But then...
DUKEÕS VISION WARPS into the disapproving floating head of...
DUKE CABOOM
Rejean... ItÕs a commercial! ItÕs 
not real! I canÕt do this!
(lifts hands in defeat)
IÕm sorry, Rejean!!
WOODY
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...!
The bike swerves. Woody grabs Duke by the helmet. Course 

corrects him. The bike HITS THE RAMP! They arc over the 

aisle...and come up short.
Thinking fast, Woody leaps off the bike -- GRABS HOLD OF 
GABBYÕS CABINET DOOR KNOB.
Duke crashes to the ground. Wakes Dragon. Speeds away.
DUKE CABOOM
WhatÕs new pussycat?
The cat gives pursuit, while HIGH ABOVE, Woody clings to the 
knob. Yanks on the yarn.
ACROSS THE WAY

Bo takes her cue. Hooks the yarn with her staff. ZIP-LINES 
over to Woody. They unlock the door with MARGARETÕS KEY.
INSIDE THE CABINET

Bo and Woody climb onto GabbyÕs shelf. No sign of anyone.
BO
Girls?
WOODY
Forky? Forky, where are you?
FORKY (O.S.)
(muffled)
YouÕre never gonna find me....
WOODY
Forky?
MUFFLED GIGGLES from inside GABBYÕS ORIGINAL BOX. Woody opens 
it to find Forky alone. He uncovers his eyes.
84.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
Woody! HowÕd you find me?
WOODY
Bo, I found him!
Bo stares at Forky in disbelief.
FORKY
Hi.
BO
Wait. ItÕs an actual fork?
ACROSS THE WAY
Buzz, Ducky & Bunny hold tight to the yarn. Giggle HOPS on 
BuzzÕs shoulder: 
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Buzz! The Dummies are gone!
He looks across -- the top of GabbyÕs cabinet is empty.
BUZZ
What? WhereÕd they go?
The toys all turn...TWO DUMMIES LOOM OVER THEM. They SCREAM.
BACK IN THE CABINET
WOODY
Okay, we can go now!
BO
No, I need to find my girls.
GABBY GABBY (O.S.)
Hello, Woody...Bo.
Gabby and Benson step out of hiding. Bo wields her staff.
BO
Where are my sheep?
FORKY
Look! Woody found me!
Another dummy comes up behind Woody. Surrounded.
GABBY GABBY
I just want to talk.
85.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Yeah, with my voicebox!
ACROSS THE WAY
The others wrestle with their dummies over the spool of yarn. 
Buzz looks over to see...Gabby and Benson closing in on Woody 
and Bo!
 -- Buzz knocks away the dummies. The gang grab hold 
of the yarn -- TUG HARD!
BUZZ
PULL!
BACK IN THE CABINET
Woody (holding Forky) is suddenly YANKED off the shelf! Gabby 
GRABS ON TO WOODYÕS PULL STRING as he flies past her...
OVER THE AISLE

Woody and Forky are now suspended mid-air. ItÕs a TUG-O-WAR!
WOODY VOICEBOX
ÒYOUÕRE MY FAVORITE -- SOMEBODY'S 
POISONED THE WATER -- IÕD LIKE TO 

JOIN YOUR POSSE -- FOR THE SKY!Ó
ON THE FLOOR
WoodyÕs voicebox draws DragonÕs attention. The cat swipes up 
at him -- Suddenly, Woody (still holding Forky) is YANKED...!
BACK INTO THE CABINET

The force TEARS OPEN WOODYÕS BACK, exposing his VOICEBOX -- 
Benson makes a grab for it -- reveals BOÕS SHEEP biting his 

backside -- Bo WHACKS Benson over with her staff...
BO
(to sheep)
Girls! Drop it.
The sheep release their grip. Rush to Bo.
The other dummy attacks Woody -- and knocks Forky out the 
cabinet to the floor below!
WOODY
No. No! Forky!
BO
We've gotta go!
86.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARSheep under her arm, Bo ziplines back across...
WOODY
No -- Wait! FORKY!
Woody looks below at Dragon stalking Forky...looks across at 
Bo just reaching the other side...makes his choice... 
...and JUMPS DOWN ON DRAGON!

Woody rides the cat like a bucking bronco. But with Woody 
still tied to the yarn, it means...
...all the other toys are pulled to the floor!
 The sheep crack -- Giggles is swallowed by Dragon -- and Buzz 
lands next to...
...BONNIEÕS BACKPACK?

It lies amongst the floor items. Forgotten. Only Buzz has the 
chance to see it. 
UP ABOVE, GabbyÕs dummies leap from the shelves:
GABBY GABBY
DonÕt let Woody leave!
The dummies encircle the gang. Dragon still bucking Woody. Bo 
takes charge of the situation:
BO
Grab on!
The toys all grab the yarn hanging off Woody.
BO
Duke! Get us out of here!
DUKE CABOOM
Oui! Here kitty, kitty!
Duke takes off on his bike, making Dragon give chase, and 

dragging the TOW LINE OF TOYS away. All except... 
WOODY
Wait! We donÕt have Forky!
Too late. One dummy grabs Forky. The other three keep after 

the Woody-Dragon-toy train racing to the BACK OF THE STORE...
With her staff, Bo YANKS A PASSING DRAWER OPEN! -- It 
clotheslines the dummies.
87.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARDuke rides his bike OUT A BROKEN WINDOW. The cat leaps out 
after him, towing the rest of the gang...
EXT. ANTIQUE STORE/BACK ALLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Duke lands. Dragon lands, spinning in a panic. The TOYS ARE 
THROWN IN ALL DIRECTIONS. Dragon SLAMS into a dumpster -- 

HACKS OUT GIGGLE -- hops back to the window. Hisses. Returns 

inside.
Woody scrambles to his feet. Grabs his hat...
WOODY
Is everyone okay?
Buzz helps Giggle as she shakes off cat drool...Bo comforts 
her sheep...Duke comforts his bike...
BO
Shh, itÕs okay.
DUKE CABOOM
Shhhhh... ItÕs okay.
...while Ducky canÕt find Bunny. Only a CLUMP OF FLUFF.
DUCKY
Bunny? -- BUNNY?!
Ducky grabs the fluff, CRYING. DoesnÕt see itÕs attached to 

BUNNY LYING IN THE TRASH. He stands. Lifts Ducky in the air.
DUCKY
(gasps; hugs him)
Oh Bunny!
BUNNY
ItÕs gonna be okay...
WOODY
ForkyÕs still in there. If we 

hurry, we can get him before they 

lock him up.
Woody starts walking back towards the window.
DUCKY
You want us to go back in there?
DUKE CABOOM
We barely got out alive.
BUZZ
Woody, itÕs better if we wait--
88.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
No, no. ThereÕs no time. We 
can easily get back inside -- 

By my count there are only 

four dummies -- and we out 

number them. So we have the 

advantage--
BUZZ
-- But I saw Bonnie's -- But 

the backpack --
BO
Woody, look at us!
Woody finally stops. Takes in the gang. A broken mess.
BO
Nobody is with you. ItÕs over, 

okay?
Determined, Woody picks up DukeÕs bike...
WOODY
No, no. WeÕre wasting time. We can 

do this.
BUNNY
Come on, Pullstring.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
ItÕs not worth it.
Woody helps Bunny with his stuffing. HeÕs not giving up...
DUCKY
Yeah, listen to her!
BO
Nobody wants this!
WOODY
I do!
BO
Why?
WOODY
Because!
BO
Why?!
WOODY
Just -- because.
-- Bo HOOKS WOODY. Forces him to look her in the eye.
89.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
WHY?!
WOODY
BECAUSE ITÕS ALL I HAVE LEFT TO DO!
(more sober)
I donÕt have anything else.
Awkward silence.
BO
So the rest of us donÕt count?
WOODY
T-thatÕs not what I meant. Bonnie 
needs Forky.
BO
No. YOU need Bonnie...Open your 

eyes Woody. ThereÕs plenty of kids 

out there...It canÕt be just about 

the one youÕre still clinging to.
Woody winces. Then bristles.
WOODY
ItÕs called Òloyalty.Ó Something a 

lost toy wouldnÕt understand.
Bo is stunned. Woody wavers, seeing the hurt in her eyes... 

then digs back in. Stubborn.
BO
IÕm not the one whoÕs lost.
(to the others)
LetÕs get out of here. WeÕve got a 

carnival that leaves in the 

morning.
Bo starts walking away. Giggle hops up on her shoulder. Duke, 

Ducky & Bunny join them.
BUNNY
CÕmon. WeÕll find our OWN kid.
DUCKY
(to Woody)
YouÕre crazy.
WOODY
Bo-- !
90.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBO
Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie.
Bo and her gang disappear into the darkness. ItÕs just Buzz 
and Woody now.
BUZZ
Woody...you did all you could. 

...Time to go home.
But Woody barely hears him, still staring off, still stuffing 

the pain down -- thereÕs a job to do (or else who am I now?)
WOODY
No.
Woody heads for the store...climbs up to the window...
BUZZ
Woody...
WOODY
I donÕt leave toys behind, Buzz.
BUZZ
Yeah, but, Woody, youÕre actually 

lea--
WOODY
Not now. Not ever.
...and disappears inside.

!!
GABBY GABBY
Hello, Woody. I knew youÕd be back.
Woody grabs a STRAY PENCIL. Walks backwards with it to defend 

himself as Gabby and dummies advance.
WOODY
You donÕt know me.
GABBY GABBY
But I do...you were left in the 

closet...feeling useless... 

wondering if youÕll ever get played 

with...
WOODY
IÕm not leaving without Forky.

Can we agree on just one thing?
WOODY
What?
GABBY GABBY
That being there for a child is the 
most noble thing a toy can do.
Woody stops. Suspicious, but willing to listen.
WOODY
Okay...
GABBY GABBY
I was defective right out of the 

box.
Gabby raises her hand to halt the dummies. Alone, she moves 

closer to Woody as she pleads her case:
GABBY GABBY (CONT'D)
I can only imagine what it must 

have been like for you. All that 

time you spent with Andy...riding a 

bike with him for the first time, 

comforting him when he skinned his 

knee, proudly watching him grow up, 

and then you got a second chance 

with Bonnie, giving her comfort 

when sheÕs scared at school, 

helping her when she needs it most. 

YouÕve been there through all their 

ups and downs...Please. Be honest 

with me - was it as wonderful as it 

sounds?
Woody takes this in. His eyes canÕt deny it.
WOODY
...It was.
Gabby smiles sadly.
GABBY GABBY
All I want is a chance for just one 

of those moments. IÕd give anything 

to be loved the way you have.
Woody is quiet. Knowing what he has to do.
93.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
Just leave me Forky. Bonnie needs 
him.
GABBY GABBY
Of course.
Gabby steps back. The dummies close in around Woody.
EXT. RV PARK - EVENING
Dad tightens the last lug nut on the new tire. 
BONNIEÕS DAD
(triumphant laugh)
Finally! The flat tire is fixed!
INSIDE THE RV

The toys sit grouped on the bed, waiting by the REAR WINDOW. 
JESSIE
Come on Woody, hurry up! Where is 
he-- ?
BUZZ POPS UP right in front of her! The startled toys YELL! 

Dolly and Jessie help him back inside.
JESSIE
Buzz!
DOLLY
WhereÕs Woody?
HAMM
And Forky?
BUZZ
We have a situation. They need to 

be extracted from the antique 

store.
REX
How do we do that?
Before Buzz can answer -- BONNIE AND HER PARENTS ENTER! 

Everyone is forced to goes limp.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Okay. LetÕs make sure we have 

everything.
BONNIE'S MOM
Finally!
94.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARCLOSE ON BONNIEÕS TOYS
They glance to Buzz with concern, but he remains confident. 
As WE WATCH BONNIE SCAN THE RV, Buzz explains:
BUZZ
(low whisper)
ItÕs okay. Any minute now, Bonnie 

will notice her backpack is 

missing, sheÕll realize she left it 

at the antique store, and we'll 

head back in there.
BONNIEÕS MOM
Looks like we have everything. You 

good, Bonnie?
BONNIE
Yep.
BONNIE'S DAD
Great. Let's get out of here.
Mom buckles Bonnie into her carseat. Dad STARTS THE ENGINE.
HAMM
Okay, genius. Whadda we do now?
Buzz rolls over. Starts pressing his voice command button:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
ÒSCANNING PERIMETER -- LASER AT 

FULL POWER! SHIELDS TO MAXIMUM!...Ó
REX
Buzz what are you doing?
BUZZ
IÕm thinking.
BUZZ KEEPS PRESSING, but no solution is coming.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Honey, will you please shut that 

toy off?
BUZZ VOICEBOX
Ò...NO TIME TO EXPLAIN! ATTACK! -- 

METEOR SHOWER, LOOK OUT! -- ITÕS A 

SECRET MISSION IN UNCHARTED SPACE! 

LETÕS GO!...Ó
95.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBONNIEÕS MOM
Yeah, I got it.
Dad puts the car into gear. Mom picks up Buzz... 
BONNIEÕS MOM
Bonnie, how do you turn this off?
BONNIE
I dunno.
...Mom looks him over, but every time BuzzÕs BACK FACES HER 
he SNEAKS ANOTHER PRESS of his voice command:
BUZZ VOICEBOX
Ò...BUZZ LIGHTYEAR TO THE RESCUE! --

FULL SPEED AHEAD! -- OPEN THE POD 

BAY DOORS! -- ITÕS JUST YOU AND ME 

NOW CADET. -- A DISTRESS SIGNAL IS 

COMING FROM THAT ROCK! -- TO 

INFINITY AND BEYOND!...Ó
OUT THE RV, Buzz sees the antique store getting further away.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Just toss it in a drawer!
Mom opens a cupboard, places Buzz inside...No more time!!
BUZZ
(REAL VOICE)
YOUR BACKPACKÕS IN THE ANTIQUE 

STORE! LETÕS GO!
Bonnie suddenly remembers!
BONNIE
Oh no my backpack!
WIDE ON THE RV
It brakes mid-turn out of the park.
BONNIE (CONTÕD; O.S.)
I left my backpack in the antique 
store!
BONNIEÕS MOM (O.S.)
You did?
BONNIEÕS DAD (O.S.)
(frustrated sigh)
Alright, letÕs swing by and get it.
96.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARThe RV backs up, and heads towards the store.
EXT. CAROUSEL AREA - NIGHT
BELOW SOME BUSHES, Bo, Giggle, Duke, Ducky & Bunny pause for 
the coast to be clear to access the CAROUSEL. The toys all 

wait for BoÕs signal (Giggle on her shoulder):
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
I canÕt believe the nerve of that 

cowboy. Who does he think he is?
(re: sheep BLEAT)
Exactly! He was way outta line. You 

did the right thing leaving him 

behind.
Bo, is quiet. Focused...yet distracted.
DUKE CABOOM
Hey, lambchops.
BO
Hm?
DUKE CABOOM
Coast is clear.
BO
Oh!
Bo snaps out of it. Leads the gang across the clearing to... 
UNDER THE CAROUSEL

Holding at the LIP EDGE, Bo points to the CENTER OF THE RIDE:
BO
Head to the middle. When the 
carnival leaves tomorrow, weÕll 

hide right there.
Between them and the center is a MAZE OF ROTATING PISTONS 

(horse rods.) One rod CRUSHES A SODA CAN as it passes.
DUCKY/BUNNY/DUKE CABOOM
Oh, no way!/Stuff that!/Awesome.
BO
Stick with me, youÕll be fine. 

Ready?
97.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBUNNY/DUCKY
NO!!
Giggle is back in Bo's ear:
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
And another thing, Woody 
asked you for help...and he 

treats you like that?...
BO
(waits)
On your mark...get set...
(crouches to run)
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES (CONTÕD)
...He only cares about himself.
Bo stops and turns.
BO
 -- No!
But Ducky & Bunny go -- SLAM!! -- The very first rod sweeps 

the two plushies out of sight.
BO
You're wrong. Woody's always trying 

to do right by his kid...
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
...by putting everyone in danger. 

Ugh, that kinda crazy 

loyalty...just...
BO
You gotta love him for it.
Bo and the others weave effortlessly through the moving rods. 

Ducky & Bunny come screaming past again...
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Whoa, say what now?...Hey hey hey, 

Bo! WhatÕs the plan? Fill me in 

here!
...They reach the center. Bo rights the OVERTURNED 

SKUNKMOBILE. The sheep jump in...Duke rides in...Bo, at the 

wheel, CALLS OUT to Ducky & Bunny as they come back around:
BO
Get in! WeÕre going back.
Ducky & Bunny jump off. Can barely stand up, dizzy...
BUNNY
Hold on, we just got here--
98.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARGIGGLE MCDIMPLES
You heard Bo, weÕre going back. 
Move your plush. LetÕs ride!
Bo practically sweeps them up as the SKUNKMOBILE RACES AWAY!
BLACK

NOISES in the dark. A RIP...RHYTHMIC SEWING...Now voices:
WOODY VOICEBOX
ÒYOUÕRE MY FAVORITE--ZENNED THE 
WATERHO--THEREÕS A SNAKE--!Ó
An IMAGE COMES INTO FOCUS. ItÕs WOODYÕS POV. WeÕre in...
INT. ANTIQUE STORE - SEWING ÒNOTIONSÓ BOOTH
Woody lies under an old sewing machine, operated by Benson. 
The dummy bites down on the thread sewn into Woody. He 

GROANS, and sits up. Woozy.
GABBY GABBY (O.S.)
Yay!
Gabby SITS up beside him, clapping for joy. Pulls her string:
GABBY GABBY VOICEBOX
ÒYOU ARE MY BEST FRIEND. LETÕS PLAY 

ALL DAY!Ó
(to Benson; as herself)
Oh, Benson! Did you hear that? 

IsnÕt that lovely?
(pulls again; VOICEBOX)
ÒTIME FOR TEA!Ó
(to Woody; as herself)
Oh, thank you, Woody! Thank you! 

All my dreams are coming true 

because of you. Thank you! Thank 

you!
She hugs Woody tight.
WOODY
Uhhh...your welcome.
GABBY GABBY
ItÕs time Benson.
Benson pulls up the BABY CARRIAGE. Forky sits inside. Gabby 

climbs in.
99.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARGABBY GABBY
Goodbye Forky. IÕm going to miss 
our talks.
FORKY
Me too. Good luck, Gabby.
GABBY GABBY
Thank you my little utensil.
A farewell hug. She helps Forky up to the sewing table. 

Benson wheels Gabby away.
FORKY 
Bye Gabby! Good Bye Benson!
Benson's head lolls back, mouth open wide in a... smile?
FORKY
(nervous laugh)
He is terrifying...
The front door CHIMES!
BONNIEÕS MOM
Hi.
WOODY
(gasp)
Bonnie?
Woody scrambles to get a look at BONNIE AND HER MOM ENTERING 

THE STORE:
MARGARET
Hello. Can I help you with 

anything?
BONNIEÕS MOM
We called about the backpack?
MARGARET
Oh, yes. I couldnÕt find it. Feel 

free to look around.
Woody SCANS THE STORE. He canÕt believe it -- thereÕs 
BONNIEÕS BACKPACK on the floor
 beside GabbyÕs case!
WOODY
Quick! Before she finds it!
Woody sprints for the backpack. Forky follows...then suddenly 

STOPS.
100.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
Look! ThereÕs Harmony.
PEEKING BETWEEN THE ANTIQUES, Forky can see Gabby Gabby 
sitting on shelf...near Harmony
 (who reads a book.) Gabby 
surreptitiously pulls her own string:
GABBY GABBY VOICEBOX
ÒYOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY. LETÕS BE 

BEST FRIENDS.Ó
Harmony looks up. Eyes the Gabby Gabby doll on the shelf...
FORKY
Oh this is it!
BACK WITH WOODY
He reaches the backpack. Dives inside!
WOODY
WeÕre going home Forky!
Looks around. No Forky. Woody peeks out...
WOODY
(loud whisper)
FORKY?!
...and spots Forky down the aisle, transfixed by something. 
Annoyed, Woody rushes back to get him -- but Forky points:
FORKY
No no no Woody, look -- it's really 

happening!
WE STAY WITH WOODY AND FORKY
 as they watch...
Harmony take Gabby down from the shelf. She turns the doll 

over. Pulls her string...
GABBY GABBY VOICEBOX
ÒIÕM GABBY GABBY, AND I LOVE YOU.Ó
FORKY
Oh, IÕm gonna cry!
Harmony touches GabbyÕs face. The dollÕs eyes locked with 

hers. At last...
MARGARET
Oh, what have you got there?
101.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARHARMONY
I found this old doll.
MARGARET
You can take it home if you want.
Beat.
HARMONY
Nah.
Harmony tosses her in an OLD CRATE. Skips away. The lifeless 
Gabby just lies there. Stunned. Discarded.
Woody and Forky GASP WITH SHOCK:
FORKY
What happened? Gabby was supposed 
to be her toy...
BONNIE (O.S.)
ThereÕs my backpack! Mom! ItÕs over 

here!
No more time! Clutching Forky, Woody races to the backpack, 

leaps in, and zips it closed just before...
...Bonnie picks it up. Checks inside...
BONNIE
Forky! Mom! I found him!
BONNIEÕS MOM
THERE he is. Now please leave him 
in there so he doesn't get lost 

again.
INSIDE THE BACKPACK
As Bonnie carries them away, Woody STARES OUT THE BACKPACK 
WINDOW - eyes locked on the crate Gabby was tossed in.
FORKY
But, what about Gabby?
Woody makes a decision. Looks to Forky.
WOODY
Forky, listen to me very carefully, 

this is important. Tell Buzz to get 

the RV to the Merry-go-Round. You 

understand?
102.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARFORKY
Absolutely! What is a merry-go-
round?
WOODY
The spinny ride, with lights and 

horses!
FORKY
Oh...you mean a carousel?
WOODY
Yes, yes, a--
(surprised)
Carousel. Yes! Meet me at the 

carousel.
FORKY
Got it.
Woody sneaks out of the backpack, and drops into the shadows 

just as...
...Bonnie and Mom exit the store. Margaret flips the sign to 
CLOSED.
MOMENTS LATER

Woody appears next to GabbyÕs crate. He peeks in. GABBY LIES 
amongst the junk, unmoving. Her back to him.
WOODY
(whisper)
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!
GABBY GABBY
You can have your voice box back. I 

donÕt need it anymore.
Woody climbs in. Tries to pull Gabby up.
WOODY
Oh, yes you do. Harmony wasnÕt your 

only chance, Gabby, but we have to 

hurry, come on--
GABBY GABBY
(pulls away; adamant)
No. Harmony was my chance. My 

timeÕs over. Now please go away.
Woody SIGHS. Takes a seat beside her. Knows all too well what 

sheÕs going through. Then, in the stillness...
103.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARWOODY
...You hear that?
Gabby listens. Turns her head towards the FRONT WINDOW. 
Carnival lights glow across the street. The distant, muffled 

shrieks of joy can be heard. CHILDREN.
WOODY
A friend once told me, ÒThere are 

plenty of kids out there.Ó
ON GABBY GABBY
The yearning in her eyes says, ÒIf only that were true.Ó
WOODY
And one of them is named ÒBonnie.Ó 
SheÕs waiting for you right now. 

She just doesnÕt know it yet.
Gabby isnÕt convinced.
GABBY GABBY
What if...youÕre wrong?
WOODY
(stands)
Well...If you sit on a shelf the 

rest of your life, youÕll never 

find out, will ya?
Bo suddenly drops into the crate from the shadows. She and 

Woody exchange a knowing smile.
BO
HeÕs right.
His eyes stay locked on Bo as he adds:
WOODY
I learned that from the best.
BO
Come on, Gabby. LetÕs get you to 

Bonnie.
Bo offer her hand. Gabby cautiously takes it.
EXT. GRAND BASIN STREET - NIGHT
The RV is headed out of town.
104.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARINSIDE THE RV
Bonnie sleeps in her car seat, holding Forky upside down. He 
CONVERSES IN WHISPERS with the other TOYS UNDER THE TABLE:
BUZZ
The carousel?
FORKY
Yeah, itÕs the spinny ride with 

lights and horses. Woody said to 

meet him there.
MR. POTATO HEAD
You gotta be kiddin!
TRIXIE
How do we do that?
BUTTERCUP
Oh! We could a--
DOLLY
WeÕre not sending Dad to jail.
BUTTERCUP
YouÕre no fun.
GPS (O.S.)
Left. Turn. In. Point five. miles.
JessieÕs attention is drawn to the GPS SCREEN ON THE DASH.
JESSIE
Wait a second. I have an idea...
INT. SECOND CHANCE ANTIQUES - NIGHT
Gabby, Woody and Bo sit in the BABY CARRIAGE, with Benson at 
the ready. Bo looks below to her sheep, who sit in the 

SKUNKMOBILE, carrying Duke, Ducky & Bunny.
They watch MARGARET OUTSIDE, bringing in a street sign.

Bo gives the signal -- and the skunk takes off towards the 
OPEN FRONT DOOR...Benson pushes the carriage fast right 

behind them...hops inside just as they zoom past an oblivious 

Margaret, and...
RACE ACROSS THE STREET 
105.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARThe toy caravan jumps the curb INTO THE CARNIVAL CROWD, 
crashing into a metal barricade. The carriage tips over.
A CONCERNED WOMAN rushes over. Lifts up the carriage, to 
reveal -- only a frozen Benson
. She SCREAMS IN HORROR.
EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
Woody, Bo, Gabby and the others are HIDDEN BETWEEN BOOTHS, 
taking in THE SEA OF CARNIVAL-GOERS:
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Too many people. Gonna need an 

alternate route.
GABBY GABBY
(worried)
Will we make it to the carousel in 

time?
Looking past her, Woody and Bo EYE THE FERRIS WHEEL turning 

next to them. Both get the same idea:
BO/WOODY
Yes, we Canada.
They look at Duke, who just stares back.
DUKE CABOOM
What? What is it?
BACK IN THE RV
Dad signals to turn left, when the GPS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTS:
TRIXIE (O.S.)
(as GPS)
Recalculating. Take. A. Right.
Dad looks at the dash. Confused.
BONNIEÕS DAD
What? A right?
TRIXIE (O.S.)
(as GPS)
Right. Turn. Ahead.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Huh. Does the GPS sound funny to 
you?
106.

Honey, itÕs fine. Just drive.
BONNIEÕS DAD
Huh. Thought it sounded funny.
UNDER THE DASH
Trixie is taking her voice commands from Mrs. Potato Head 
(sans one ear), who is taking her cues from...
ATOP THE RV

...Buzz. Crouched on the roof. Focused on the LIGHTS OF GRAND 
BASIN in the distance. He talks into MRS. POTATO HEADÕS EAR:
BUZZ
Another right!
INSIDE / ATOP THE RV
MRS. POTATO HEAD
Right!
TRIXIE (GPS)
Take. A. Nother. Right.
BONNIEÕS MOM (O.S.)
Huh?
BONNIE'S DAD
Another right? Really?
BUZZ
(panicked)
Turn right!
Mrs. Potato Head points right urgently.
TRIXIE (GPS)
NOW! TURN RIGHT!!
Startled, Dad quickly turns right. Buzz almost slides off the 

roof as the RV crosses all lanes, and TAKES THE EXIT.
Hamm, Rex, Slinky look out the window.
HAMM
WeÕre heading back.

You think Woody will get there in 
time?
EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT
DUKE CABOOM
Nope. No way. Decline. No dice. 

Rejected --
The toy gang now sit atop the CENTER SPINDLE of the Ferris 

Wheel. A STRING OF CARNIVAL FLAGS fastened to the back of 

DukeÕs bike. Ducky & Bunny rev up his rear wheel as Woody and 

Bo coach: 
BO
Duke, Duke, you got this.
WOODY
This is the fastest way to the 

carousel. You made the last jump.
DUKE CABOOM
Yeah, but that was four feet. This 

is forty!
BO
Exactly! Duke Caboom would never 

repeat a stunt.
DUKE CABOOM
No. HeÕd never do that.
WOODY
No, no, no. HeÕs the toy that went 

on to crash forty feet...into that 

target.
Woody points to the HOLE IN THE ROOF SIGN of the ÒStar 

AdventurerÓ booth, far on the other side.
DUKE CABOOM
Yeah...He is. IÕM DUKE CA-BOOM! Oh 

man, I can DO this!
WOODY
Yes you Canada!
DUKE CABOOM
I can do it with my eyes closed.
108.

Yes, you -- what?
DUKE CABOOM
3-2-1-- GO!
WOODY
What?! What? Wait!
Too late. Duke takes off down a FERRIS WHEEL SPOKE as it 
SLOWLY RISES, making it the perfect ramp...Duke hops to his 

feet on the bike...
GABBY GABBY
What is he doing?
BO
Oh no...
...and LAUNCHES off the ferris wheel!...The string of flags 

unfurling behind him...
MID-AIR

Duke soars over the carnival. Arms out. Eyes closed...
DUKE CABOOM
This is for you, Rejean.
...and threads a perfect needle THROUGH THE TARGET! CRASHES 
on the roof behind.
DUKE CABOOM
Caboom.
Dukes drives circles around a booth strut. Secures the line.
BACK ON THE FERRIS WHEEL

The GANG ALL CHEER! Woody hurries the others:
WOODY
Alright, our turn.
BO
You heard the Sheriff, letÕs go.
The toys all ZIP-LINE down the string of flags over the 
unsuspecting crowd.

Ugh, stupid rental. IÕm turning us 

around.

No! -- Recalculating! Turn. Right.
Mom takes a closer look at the GPS.
BONNIEÕS MOM
Must be broken.
TRIXIE (O.S.; GPS)
No! No!
Dad turns left, moving away from the carousel. 
BELOW THE DASH, Mrs. Potato Head YANKS a panicked Trixie out 
of the way -- signals to BUTTERCUP!
The stuffed unicorn sneaks under DadÕs feet...and JAMS THE 
GAS PEDAL in place. The RV starts speeding.
BONNIEÕS MOM
Honey, what are you doing? 

Slow down!
BONNIEÕS DAD
WhatÕs happening?! I canÕt! I 

canÕt!

Buzz POPS his helmet closed. Braces himself.

very slowly down Main street...

Bo and Woody lead the toys, jumping across the tops of the 
game booths. They can spot the RV IN THE DISTANCE, lurching 

towards the carousel!
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
Got a visual on the RV heading 

southbound.
Woody looks back -- Gabby has stopped at the edge of the 

roof, looking down at something... 
WOODY
Gabby?
Woody rush over to her -- then sees what has her attention.
A LOST LITTLE GIRL (6) stands in the shadows behind the 
midway. Scared, alone. Crying.
GABBY GABBY
I think sheÕs lost.
Gabby turns to Woody. A plea in her eyes. ...Woody gets it.
WOODY
Are you sure?
Gabby nods. 
Bo joins them. Tracks their gaze to the lost girl. BoÕs eyes 
meet WoodyÕs, already understanding.
WOODY
Change of plans.
BACK AT THE RV
It lurches down the street. The interior lights strobe...car 
windows randomly open and shut...
UNDER THE DASH, Mrs. Potato Head unplugs-and-plugs electrical 
connectors.
A POLICE CAR appears behind them.

I-I canÕt! This is a rental! I 
donÕt know whatÕs happening!
BACK AT THE CARNIVAL
The Lost Girl cowers from the foot traffic. Afraid to make 
her plight known.
NEAR HER FEET, the toys now hide BEHIND STORAGE CRATES. Woody 
and Bo flank Gabby Gabby: 
GABBY GABBY
IÕm so nervous. What if she doesn't 

like me?
WOODY
Gabby--
GABBY GABBY
I donÕt know if I can do this...
WOODY
Gabby, itÕs just like you 

said...this is the most noble thing 

a toy can do.
Gabby looks to Bo. She gives a nod of encouragement. Coaxes 

Gabby out into the open, behind the Lost Girl:
BO
Okay. Just edge yourself a bit into 

the light - Not too far...ThatÕs 

it...
Gabby, now exposed, sits on the ground. Goes into toy mode.
BO (CONTÕD)
...Perfect.
Woody cues Ducky & Bunny, hiding on the other side.

LOST GIRL
Excuse me, can you help us?

Oh, honey, whatÕs wrong?
LOST GIRL

What the--? You gotta be kidding 

me!
HIDDEN INSIDE, Forky mans the DOOR LOCK BUTTON. Pressing it 

locked every time Dad opens it. Giggles with delight.
Meanwhile, the other toys have stacked vertically to reach 
THE AWNING SWITCH. They open it.
OUTSIDE
115.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARMom and Dad are too preoccupied with the door lock to 
notice...the AWNING UNFURL to form a bridge from the RV to 

the carousel roof.
Buzz waves to Woody to cross over. ItÕs time to go.
BUNNY
Hey...um...So long cowboy.
DUCKY
Happy trails.
Woody tips his hat to them -- BoÕs sheep nose his legs, 
BLEATING. He kneels down.
WOODY
Billy, Goat, Gruff...Take care of 

her, girls.
Sad looks from all three. Woody then stands to face...
BO

They hold each otherÕs gaze.
BO
IÕm, uh...
WOODY
(fumphering)
BO (CONT'D)
...I'm glad I got to see you again.
Woody struggles. So much to say. Where to begin...?
WOODY
I...I don't...
Bo rescues him from the moment. Hugs him goodbye. Woody then 
steps down onto the RV awning. His HANDS CLING TO THE EDGE OF 

THE RIDE, like they did to the box long ago when Bo was given 

away. 
Woody looks up at her. She adjusts his hat.
WOODY
...Goodbye, Bo.
He turns and walks across the awning to Buzz...Everything 
feels wrong.
WOODY
Buzz...I -- I...
116.

SheÕll be okay.
Woody sags with resignation. Buzz smiles.
BUZZ (CONT'D)
Bonnie...will be okay.
Surprised, Woody looks him in the eye. The words sinking in.
WOODY
...You sure?
BUZZ
Hey. Listen to your inner voice.
Woody turns back to Bo. No words needed to be said. Bo can 
already tell from the look on his face...She JUMPS DOWN to 

the awning...
...Both toys RUN INTO EACH OTHERÕS ARMS
. The kind of embrace 
that one waits a lifetime for.

Then, Woody notices -- ALL THE TOYS are now atop the RV. They 
rush cross the awning. Overjoyed to reunite. Jessie hugs Bo:
BO
(softly)
Jessie...
JESSIE
Bo!
Woody looks at the faces of all of his friends, old and new. 

So much shared between them acknowledged in silence.
Woody then REMOVES HIS BADGE and...PINS IT ON JESSIE. The 
meaning sinks in for her. Overcome, Jessie bear hugs Woody. 

Spins him around...
The rest of AndyÕs toys take JessieÕs cue, and JOIN IN A 
GROUP HUG, jostling and laughing together...
...except Buzz.

The space ranger hangs back. As the laughter dies down, Woody 
steps up to his old pal...AND THE TWO EMBRACE. A deep Òthank 

youÓ for a friendship earned like no other.
-- Something tugs at Woody? Looks down to find Forky hugging 
his knees.
WOODY
So long, Forky.
They hug. Buzz smiles -- then realizes...

Forky? WhoÕs watching the doors?
The RV ENGINE starts!
The toys scatter - Woody and Bo back to the carousel, 
Bonnie's toys to the RV...
INSIDE THE RV

Mom helps Bonnie into her seat. Suddenly --
BONNIE'S MOM
Oh my goodness, the awning. What is 
going on?
As she turns to flip the switch, the TOYS DROP TO THE BED 

FROM THE SKYLIGHT! Bonnie looks back to see...
...Forky nestled safely with all of her toys.

ATOP THE CAROUSEL

Woody and Bo watch the RV pull away. He then looks to Bo, who 
reaches for his hat...and yanks it over his eyes. She takes 

off running. Woody chases her to the PEAK OF THE CAROUSEL 

ROOF. They watch the RV continue to drive away...
INSIDE THE RV

BONNIEÕS TOYS have gathered at the REAR WINDOW, looking back.
REX
Does this mean WoodyÕs a lost toy?
BUZZ
HeÕs not lost. Not anymore.
CLOSE ON BUZZ, gaze fixed on the carousel.
BUZZ
To infinity...
CLOSE ON WOODY, Bo at his side, as they wave goodbye.
WOODY
...and beyond.
Above it all, the moon shines fully in the clear night sky, 
championing the endless possibilities ahead.

EXT. SEASIDE TOWN - DAY
A CARNIVAL is set up along the beach. At THE STAR ADVENTURER 
BOOTH, the bored carnie listens to his headphones while a 

HAPPY LITTLE BOY skips away with a winning prize.
CLOSE ON THE PRIZE WALL

Two morose PLUSH FROGS contemplate their fates.
CARNIVAL PRIZE FROG #1
There goes another one.
CARNIVAL PRIZE FROG #2
We're never getting out of here.
BUNNY (O.S.)
Psst, Frog legs.
DUCKY (O.S.)
Up here, Rainbow Connection.
Ducky and Bunny hang above them.
BUNNY
You Mr. Toads wanna take a wild 
ride with a kid?
DUCKY
We can make that happen...
CARNIVAL PRIZE FROG #1 & 2
You CAN?!...Really?!
DUCKY
Oh, yeah! Leave it to us, Jeremiah.
MOMENTS LATER
A LITTLE GIRL shoots at the target. Misses.

Behind the scenes, Ducky & Bunny pull down the target anyway. 
DING! She won!
BELOW THE COUNTER, Bo gives the signal -- Duke and Woody toss 
a Carnival Frog onto the counter for the girl. She skips away 

with her prize, elated. The carnie oblivious.

©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARBACK AT THE STAR ADVENTURER BOOTH
A LONG LINE OF KIDS step up -- shoot, miss -- win a prize. 
Repeat. The carnie still oblivious...
DISSOLVE TO NIGHT

The clueless carnie now leans against a COMPLETELY EMPTY 
BOOTH. 
BEHIND THE COUNTER, The toy rescue gang conference:
WOODY
Alright, nice job, gang!
BO
Every prize with a kid.
GIGGLE MCDIMPLES
WhatÕs next?
DUCKY
Leave that to us.
BUNNY
We know EXACTLY what to do.
DUCKY
Mmm-Hmm.

EXT. STAR ADVENTURER BOOTH - NIGHT
The Carnie yawns, turns back to the booth -- shocked to see 
it empty of toys. He leans over the counter...
-- Ducky and Bunny attach to his face!!
BUNNY
PLUSH RUSH! That's right!
DUCKY
PLUSH RUSH! How you like 
THAT?! Huh?! You got Plush 

Rushed, son!
The Carnie PANICS, rips the plush dolls off him. Bunny SHOOTS 

LASERS FROM HIS EYES at the carnieÕs feet.
DUCKY
Dance, HA HA! Dance! Get your knees 

up! LetÕs see those feet move!
120.
©2019 DISNEY¥PIXARThe Carnie runs. Ducky & Bunny hulk out, laughing maniacally 
as they GROW to full Kaiju size. Stomp after him firing 

lasers, breathing fire --
BACK TO REALITY

Still behind the counter, a normal-sized Ducky & Bunny make 
laser sounds as the toy gang stare at them, unfazed. 
BO
OR, we could get more toys to 

kids...
WOODY
Yeah, letÕs do that.
Bo and Woody exit. Eyes wide, Duke rolls forward on his bike.
DUKE CABOOM
Do you...really have laser eyes?
Ducky and Bunny exchange a look.
BUNNY
Yeah.
DUKE CABOOM
Whoa.

INT. BONNIE'S ROOM - DAY
Bonnie enters, drops off her backpack and leaves.
BONNIE
Hi toys. Bye Toys.
The toys approach the backpack. Something stirs inside...it 
unzips...and Jessie steps out.
DOLLY
JessieÕs back!
TRIXIE
WhatÕs first grade like? Tell me 

everything.
JESSIE
Well, it was--
