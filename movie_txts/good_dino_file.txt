ROCKY SLOPE/BERRY TREE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)Arlo balances on a boulder, trying to reach the berries hanging high in a tree.   The boulder tilts down the small incline... Arlo almost loses his balance, but catches himself. His hunger is making him more daring. He stretches his neck forward, blowing on the berries to get them to swing closer to him. He tries to grab them with his teeth. Almost got them --CRACK. The boulder gives way, tumbling down the slope. Arlo crashes to the ground! BAM... BAM.Arlo lays there stunned, frustrated.

The drizzle turns into rain. ArloÕs footprints become puddles. THUNDERCLAP.Arlo collects sticks to build a makeshift shelter. But after only propping up three sticks, they tumble to the ground.  Nearby creatures are nestled in their dwellings, dry, safe. Arlo notices one FURRY CRITTER, sitting under an overhung rock, has taken particular interest in watching ArloÕs efforts.  Arlo tries positioning larger branches, and has more success.  He sits inside his shelter, proud, smiling at the critter under the rock. The critter keeps staring. Arlo sticks his tongue out at it. DRIP. DRIP. SPLASH. A puddle pours down onto ArloÕs face.The critter squeaks, as if laughing at Arlo. It goes away and comes back with TWO OTHER CRITTERS (implying ÒletÕs watch thisÓ).
