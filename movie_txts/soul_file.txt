©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        A BAD MIDDLE SCHOOL BAND PLAYS THE DISNEY LOGO THEME. 
ONCE IT ENDS...
JOE (O.S.)
Alright! LetÕs try something else. 
Uh...from the top. Ready? One, two, 

three...
INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL BAND ROOM.
JOE GARDNER, a passionate, well-dressed middle-aged man, 
conducts an off-key middle school band. ItÕs painfully bad.
JOE
One, two, three, four! Stay on the 

beat! Two, three four--thatÕs a C 

Sharp, horns!
A TROMBONIST loses his trombone end, which lands on the floor 

with a CLANK.
A TRUMPETER uses his horn to vacuum up M&Ms from the floor.

CALEB, a saxophonist, pretends to play while actually on his 
iPHONE.
JOE 
Two, three, I see you, Caleb!
Startled, Caleb tosses the phone into a neighboring studentÕs 

sax.
JOE
(to another student)
Rachel, now you!
But Rachel lies across a few chairs.
RACHEL
Forgot my sax, Mr. G.
JOE
Okay, she forgot her sax! Aaand now-

- aaaaall you, Connie. Go for it!
Joe then motions to CONNIE, a Chinese American girl holding a 

trombone. SheÕs his last hope.
Connie plays her solo, strong and passionate. Joe smiles. 

But some of the other kids start giggling, and ConnieÕs 
confidence (and playing) suddenly wilts.

Way to go!
Joe taps his music stand.
JOE 
Hang on, hang on. What are yÕall 
laughing at?
The kids quiet down.
JOE 
So Connie got lost in it. ThatÕs a 

good thing!
Connie stews in her seat, embarrassed, as Joe addresses the 

class.
JOE 
Look, I remember one time... my dad 

took me to this jazz club, and 

thatÕs the last place that I wanted 

to be.
Joe walks to the piano and starts playing while he explains:
JOE
But then I see this guy. And heÕs 

playing these chords with fourths 

on it and then, with the minor. 

Whooo! Then he adds the inner 

voices, and itÕs like heÕs... itÕs 

like heÕs singing. And I swear, the 

next thing I know... itÕs like he 

he floats off the stage. That guy 

was lost in the music. He was 
in
 it, and he took the rest of us with 

him.
Joe finishes with a beautiful, dreamy flourish. The class is 

captivated with his music.
JOE
And I wanted to learn how to talk 

like that. ThatÕs when I knew. I 

was born to play. 
(beat)
Connie knows what I mean. Right, 

Connie?
CONNIE
IÕm twelve.
A KNOCK on the classroom door interrupts.

IÕll be right back. Practice your 
scales.
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Joe pops into the hall to speak with PRINCIPAL ARROYO as bad 
scales emanate from the classroom behind him.
PRINCIPAL ARROYO
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Gardner.
JOE
Heh heh, youÕre doing my ears a 

favor.
A STUDENT exits the class doorway behind Joe:
CALEB
Hey!
JOE
Not you, though. YouÕre good.
When the student leaves:
JOE 
(whispering)
HeÕs not.
The Principal CHUCKLES.
JOE 
What can I do for you, Principal 

Arroyo?
PRINCIPAL ARROYO
I wanted to deliver the good news 

personally!
She hands Joe a letter:
PRINCIPAL ARROYO
No more part-time for you. YouÕre 

now our full-time band teacher! Job 

security. Medical insurance. 

Pension.
JOE
Wow. ThatÕs...great.

Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe. 
Permanently.
JOE
Thanks.
Joe forces a smile. 
He reenters the classroom and sadly looks at the wall, 
covered with photos of jazz greats.
INT. LIBBAÕS TAILOR SHOP.
A busy tailor shop bustling with activity. LIBBA, JoeÕs 
mother, hems a dress on a CUSTOMER. 
LibbaÕs assistants, MELBA and LULU, work away at sewing 
machines. 
Joe is folding his laundry, poorly.
LIBBA
After all these years, my prayers 
have been answered! A full-time 

job!
LULU
Wonderful, wonderful!
MELBA
WorkinÕ man, cominÕ through!
JOE
Yeah. But mom I...
Joe rolls each piece of clothing and places it in the basket.
LIBBA
YouÕre going to tell them yes, 

right?
JOE
DonÕt worry Mom, I got a plan.
LIBBA
You always got a plan.
She begins poking the customer with pins as she talks.
CUSTOMER
Ow!
LIBBA
Maybe you need to have a backup 

plan too...

Ow-ow!
LIBBA
...for when your plan falls 
through.
MELBA
A back up plan never hurt.
LULU
Mmmhmm.
JOE
Hm.
LIBBA
Joey. We didnÕt struggle giving you 

an education so you could be a 

middle-aged man washing your 

underwear in my shop.
Libba holds up an pair embarrassing underwear from JoeÕs 

laundry basket. 
MELBA
Mm, Mmm, Mmm.
LULU
(at sight of underwear)
walkinÕ around with a hole in 

his pants...
*Lulu grabs the undies and checks them out, shaking her head.
JOE
Yeah, but-
Joe snatches the underwear and throws them back into his 

basket.
LIBBA
With this job, youÕll be able to 

put that dead-end gigging behind 

you. And Lord knows, we need more 

teachers in this world. And just 

think, playing music will finally 

be your real career!
Joe can see this is a losing battle.
LIBBA 
So, youÕre going to tell them 
yes
, 
right?
Joe is about to protest...

(pleading)
Please, say yes.
...but instead closes his mouth.
JOE
Yeah. Definitely.
LIBBA
Good.
BZZZ! JoeÕs phone rings. He fishes it out and answers.
JOE 
Hello?
CURLEY (O.S.)
How you been, Mr. G? Uh, ItÕs 
Curley. Lamont, Lamont Baker.
Joe turns away from Libba as she tends to the customer.
JOE
Hey! Curley! Hey, good to hear your 

voice, man. Uh listen, you can call 

me Joe now, Curley. IÕm not your 

teacher anymore.
CURLEY (O.S.)
Okay Mr. Gardner. Hey, look, IÕm 

the new drummer in the Dorothea 

Williams Quartet and weÕre kicking 

off our tour with a show at The 

Half Note tonight.
JOE
Dorothea Williams?! Are you kidding 

me? Congratulations, man! Wow, I 

would die a happy man if I could 

perform with Dorothea Williams.
CURLEY (O.S.)
Well, this could be your lucky day!
EXT. NEW YORK STREET. DAY.
Joe SPRINTS DOWN THE STREET, weaving between NEW YORKERS. He 
comes up to a brick building -- the renowned HALF NOTE jazz 

club.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        INT. HALF NOTE -- ENTRY HALL.
Joe catches his breath as he walks down the stairs. Photos of 
jazz greats line the wall. He gazes at them, taking off his 

hat in reverence. 
Deep in the club we hear a jazz band WARMING UP. 

CURLEY BAKER, a burley drummer in his 20s, meets Joe.
CURLEY
Woo, there he is! 
JOE
Hey, Curley.
CURLEY
Leon skipping town really put us in 
a bind, man.
JOE
IÕll bet.
CURLEY
IÕm glad you made it. My boy Bishop 

said he sat in on with you on a set 

last year in Brooklyn. Said you 

were great.
JOE
Well... you know, for a coffee 

shop.
They enter the small club -- a low-lit New York treasure 

filled with mood and history.
Warming up on stage with her sax is DOROTHEA WILLIAMS, the 
regal, no-nonsense leader of the Dorothea Williams Quartet. 
Joe looks on in amazement as she plays. ItÕs effortless and 
tight. They respectfully wait for an opening.
CURLEY
Hey Dorothea, this is the cat I was 

telling you about. My old middle 

school band teacher, Mr. Gardner!
JOE
Call me Joe, Dorothea. I mean, 

um... Ms. Williams. ItÕs a 

pleasure. Wow. This is amazing.
SheÕs not impressed.

Joe is Ray GardnerÕs son.
Still not impressed. 
DOROTHEA
So weÕre down to middle school band 
teachers now.
Joe doesnÕt know what to say. Finally, Dorothea rises from 

her chair.
DOROTHEA (CONTÕD)
Get on up here, Teach. We ainÕt got 

all day.
Joe barely sits down at the piano when Dorothea starts 

playing. 
The bassist, MIHO AKAGI, and drummer (Curley) join without 
missing a beat.
JOE
(confused)
What...what are we playing--?
Dorothea doesnÕt answer. 
Joe misses a few beats but jumps into the music, trying to 
keep up and figure out where the music is going. 
He finally eases into the tune when Dorothea stops playing 
and points to him -- a signal for Joe to solo. She looks off 

stage and listens.
Joe takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates on 
the keys.
The music flows into an incredible solo. The room slips away 
as Joe goes into the zone
, a place weÕll come to know as the 
Astral Plane. 
He finally comes out of his trance, and looks up to see the 
band has stopped playing. Everyone is staring at him.
JOE 
Uh, sorry. I zoned out a little 

back there. Heh.
Joe thinks heÕs doomed. Dorothea just stares. Finally:
DOROTHEA
Joe Gardner, where have you been?

DOROTHEA
You got a suit?
JOE
I...!
DOROTHEA
Get a suit, Teach. A good suit. 

Back here tonight. First showÕs at 

9. SoundcheckÕs at 7. WeÕll see how 

you do.
She walks offstage.
EXT. THE HALF NOTE.
Joe explodes out of the club.
JOE
YES! WHOO HOO!
(at the sky)
You see that, Dad! ThatÕs what IÕm 
talking about!
A MAN passes by with a stroller. Joe runs up to him, pointing 

up at the Half Note marquee.
JOE 
Look up, look up! You know what 

thatÕs gonna say? Joe Gardner! HA 

HA!
Joe dances around him and heads down the street.
CUT TO:
Joe turns the corner, still on his cell phone:
JOE 
YouÕre never gonna believe what 

just happened! I did it. I got the 

gig! Yes!
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS.
Joe is on his phone, spreading the good news, oblivious to 
the city around him.

I know! I know! Dorothea Williams! 
Can you believe it!?
CUT TO:
CONSTRUCTION SITE.
Joe walks right under a huge pallet of bricks as itÕs lifted 
into the air. A bunch of bricks fall
, just missing him.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Hey, pal! YouÕre gonna get hurt!
But Joe doesnÕt hear her.
CUT TO:
BUSY INTERSECTION. 
Joe absently steps into traffic.
JOE
Just donÕt tell my mom about this, 
okay?
A huge bus misses him by inches. He doesnÕt notice.
CUT TO:
OUTSIDE VARIOUS STOREFRONTS. 
Still oblivious, Joe walks through a sidewalk littered with 
split banana peels, then through a pile of overturned nails. 

Amazingly, he avoids disaster while on his phone:
JOE
Forget class. IÕm in a different 

class. IÕm in a Dorothea Williams 

class buddy. You know what IÕm 

saying?
CUT TO:
STREET CORNER. 
Joe turns a corner, phone still to his ear. He nearly runs 
into an old man with an ANGRY DOG. The dog lunges at Joe, 

BARKING:
JOE
Whoa, whoa, sorry!

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        Joe turns on his heel to avoid the dog. He starts walking 
into the middle of the street. A motorcycle narrowly misses 

him. WHEW! That was close. Confident he missed death, he 

takes a step forward... and falls right into a manhole.
JOE 
AAHHHHH!
EXT. LIMBO -- SLIDEWALK.
OOF! Joe lands with a THUD on a moving slidewalk, akin to 
those in airports. 
HeÕs now a LUMINOUS SOUL
.Joe looks into the darkness, then notices his hands and feet 
are different, glowing. 
JOE
What the--?
He looks around, confused.
JOE
Hello? Hello!
He looks to where the slidewalk is headed: A GIANT WHITE 

LIGHT in the near distance -- THE GREAT BEYOND!
JOE 
What the--?
He turns and walks the other way.
But the sliding walkway counteracts Joe, causing him to walk 
in place. He looks behind him. 
The Great Beyond is still there.

Joe GASPS, turns and runs.
JOE
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
In the distance he sees three figures standing on the 
slidewalk. Joe runs to them.
JOE
Hello!
GEREL
Oh, whatÕs your name, honey?

supposed to be here!
The others look at each other.
GEREL
Ah, it must have been sudden for 

you.
(approaching Joe)
You see Joe, IÕm 106 years old. 

Been waiting a long time for this.
JOE
For what?
She points ahead.
GEREL
The Great Beyond.
JOE
The Great Beyond!? As in, as in 

beyond... 
life
!?
AMIR
Yeah.
JOE
ThatÕs DEATH right there!
MIALI

This beats my dream about the 

walrus.
GEREL
Exciting, isnÕt it!?
JOE
No! No, no, no! Listen, I have a 

gig tonight! I canÕt die now!
AMIR
Well, I really donÕt think you have 

a lot to say about this.
JOE
Yes! Yes, I do. IÕm not dying the 

VERY day I got my shot. IÕm due! 

Heck, IÕm OVER-due! Nah ah. IÕm 

outta here.
Joe walks away from them.

I donÕt think youÕre supposed to go 
that way.
But Joe keeps walking, against the slidewalkÕs flow.
JOE
(to himself)
This canÕt happen. IÕm NOT dying 

today. Not when my life just 

started!
He turns to see where the three other souls went. 
The slidewalk climbs up into the distance, into the white maw 
of the Great Beyond. The trio of souls ascend into it, then 

disappear with a crackle -- FLZZZT!
Joe freaks:
JOE
What was that! Wait!
He bolts, running desperately against the slidewalkÕs flow.
JOE
IÕm not finished! I GOTTA GET BACK! 
I DONÕT WANNA DIE!!! IÕM NOT DONE! 

IÕM NOT DONE! 
He comes to another soul, WINSTON, strangely disinterested.
JOE
RUN!!! WHY ARENÕT YOU RUNNING??
WINSTON
Idonknow...
JOE
What is wrong with you people?!
WINSTON
(shrugs)
Idonknow...
Joe keeps running. He passes another soul, JANG-MI:
JANG-MI 
(in Korean)
Where are my pants?
Joe runs into a crowd of souls. Some are blissfully aware and 

unaware, some freaking out in their own way, and in other 

languages.

Panicked, Joe tries PUSHING through them.
JOE
Ahh!! Oh my goodness, oh my 
goodness. Sorry! Sorry! Excuse me! 

Help! IÕm not done! I gotta get 

back!
Finally, Joe jumps onto their heads and runs. But the Great 

Beyond grows even closer. Finally he tries launching himself 

off the slidewalk completely. But he SMACKS against a 

cellophane-like barrier. 
Just in front, souls are being zapped into the Great Beyond 
by the handfuls. ItÕs nearly his turn!
Joe CLAWS at the barrier, screaming, desperate! 

Finally he RIPS through it and falls... 
EXT. THE GREAT BEFORE.
A portal opens, dropping Joe in what appears to be tall 
grass. He watches as the portal closes above him.
He slowly gets up and looks around another world. Beautiful 
buildings, Elysian fields and glowing crowds of strange, 
fuzzy beings
 -- NEW SOULS.
A rambunctious group of them are gathered around a COUNSELOR, 

a taller, ethereal being that looks vaguely human. 
The Counselor spots Joe. He quickly ducks down. 

But too late.

One of the new souls finds him and pokes his face, laughing. 
Joe pushes it away, but other new souls arrive, surrounding 

him. One BITES him.
JOE
Ow!
The Counselor, JERRY, appears as the new souls toss Joe into 

the air happily.
COUNSELOR JERRY 
Now, now, everyone letÕs give the 

Mentor some room.

But the souls continue to crowd Joe. One pulls at his mouth.
COUNSELOR JERRY 
37, thatÕs enough. Hey everyone, 
look here! Quiet coyote! Shh! Quiet 

coyote!
Like a kindergarten teacher, Counselor Jerry holds up two 

fingers. Immediately the other souls mimic her and quiet 

down.
JOE
Who are you?
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
I am the coming together of all 

quantized fields of the universe, 

appearing in a form your feeble 

human brain can comprehend.
JOE
Wha?

You can call me Jerry.
JOE
Jerry. Okay. Hey, is this heaven?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Ha ha, no!
JOE

A new soul pops up over JoeÕs shoulder.
NEW SOUL
Hell!

ItÕs easy to get turned around.

Oh, we call it the You Seminar now. 
Rebranding.
Joe takes in the odd surroundings, filled with playful new 

souls.
JOE
Does this mean IÕm... dead?
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Not yet. Your bodyÕs in a holding 

pattern. ItÕs complicated. IÕll get 

you back to your group.
Jerry mutates into a bizarre, four-legged bus. The Counselor 

scoops up Joe with a giant hand, setting him in a chair on 

top.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Come on, little souls! Get on up 

here!
The Counselor gathers the other souls and carries them 

through the strange campus. The impressionable new souls are 

still infatuated with Joe even as he tries to process his 

surroundings.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Welcome to the You Seminar! You are 

in for a treat!
EXT. LIMBO -- ABOVE THE SLIDEWALK.
Meanwhile, a pair of Counselors are watching the deceased 
souls pour from the slidewalk into The Great Beyond. 
While one Counselor is another Jerry, the other is shorter, 
angrier, and holds a huge ABACUS. The Counselor uses it with 

lightening precision to count every soul that enters the 

white light. This is TERRY, the accountant. 
Suddenly, Terry stops counting.
TERRY
Hmm. ThatÕs weird.

EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
Jerry (in bus form) continues to walk Joe and the new souls 
across campus.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Okay, first stop is the Excitable 

Pavilion. You four. In you go!
The new souls zoom into a glistening Personality Pavilion. 

They emerge from the other side, now excited
.NEW SOULS
Woohooo!
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
You five, youÕll be aloof. And you 

two, why not.
The new souls enter another pavilion, emerging aloof
. 
JOE
W-wait a minute. This is where 

personalities come from?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Of course! Do you think people are 

just born with them?
JOE
So uh... how do they get to Earth 

then?
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Well, they use the Earth Portal.
Jerry points. In the distance Joe sees a large, circular hole 

in the ground. Through it, Earth beckons! 
At the portalÕs edge new souls jump to Earth.

But Joe is gone.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Hello? Hello?
ELSEWHERE -- Joe sprints towards the portal. All around him 

new souls jump to Earth below as Mentors cheer them on.
MENTORS
Congratulations! YouÕre going to 

have a great life! 
Joe JUMPS! He free-falls along with several new souls toward 

the beautiful globe below, LAUGHING and CHEERING at the 

thrill ride.
But as the new souls continue down towards the Earth and 
disappear, Joe bounces off a weird, invisible barrier. He 

careens through space and is delivered right back to the You 

Seminar.
Joe tries to jump again. And again! Frustrated, he grabs a 
new soul and jumps with them, hoping to sneak into Earth 

behind it. But Joe is again spit back into the You Seminar.
Finally, he just stares down at the Earth, frustrated.

Counselor Jerry finds him.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
You sure get lost a lot!
EXT. MENTOR ORIENTATION TABLE.

Jerry brings Joe to where a group of older souls like him are 
gathered around a table, looking for their pre-printed name 

tag. These are MENTORS. 
Another Counselor Jerry gives instructions:
COUNSELOR JERRY D
All righty, mentors. Just find your 
name here...
The Counselor ushering Joe steps forward.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Hello Jerry! Got a lost mentor for 

you.

COUNSELOR JERRY A 
I understand. Mentoring isnÕt for 

everyone. YouÕre more than welcome 

to opt out.
The Counselor opens a portal straight to The Great Beyond! 
JOE
Ah! Actually, on second thought, 

you know, the mentoring sounds like 

fun.
Joe quickly grabs any name tag from the table and follows the 

group.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
I'm glad to hear it. Jerry will 

take it from here.
COUNSELOR JERRY D 
Thanks, Jerry. 
(to Joe)
Head right on over there to Jerry.
The Counselor points to 
another
 Jerry, this one in the form 
of a large theater. 
COUNSELOR JERRY F 
Thank you, Jerry.
JOE
Is

 here named Jerry?
The first Counselor watches Joe leave.

Terry the Accountant appears out of a portal.

Jerry, weÕve got a problem!

The countÕs off!
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
(chuckling)
I seriously doubt that. The count 
hasnÕt been off in centuries.
Terry produces the large abacus, using it to make her point:
TERRY
151,000 souls go into the Great 

Beyond every day. ThatÕs 105.2 

souls per minute, Jerry. 1.75 souls 

per second. And I count every 

single one of Ôem.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Yep. IÕm aware.
TERRY
ItÕs my job to keep track of this 

stuff, Jerry. IÕm the accountant.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
And we all think youÕre doing a 

wonderful job, donÕt we everyone?
The other Counselors somewhat agree.
TERRY
IÕm always counting. IÕm counting 

right now. You blinked five times 

since I started talking.
(the Counselor blinks)
Six.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Right! Since accounting is your 

job, why donÕt you figure out the 

problem.
TERRY
Maybe I will.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
Wonderful!
The Counselor vanishes. Terry angrily stalks off to:

Terry arrives in the Hall of Records. SheÕs greeted by 
another Jerry.
COUNSELOR JERRY 
Hello again, Terry!
TERRY
Don't play dumb with me.
IN A LARGE FILE ROOM --
Terry opens the first file cabinet, cracks her fingers and 
gets ready.
TERRY
Okay. Here we go. ÒA.Ó
Terry flips through the files, her fingers almost moving too 

fast for the eye to see. At this rate, it seems like it wonÕt 

take her very long.
However, an epic PULL OUT reveals that the file cabinets 
stretch on endlessly, vanishing into the horizon. This is 

going to take a while.
INT. MENTOR ORIENTATION THEATER.
Joe steps into the theater as an instructional video begins. 
Other Mentors watch from stadium seats.
ON THE SCREEN -- 

In a scratchy, well-worn corporate video, a Counselor 
explains:
COUNSELOR JERRY C
Hello there, Mentors! IÕm Jerry, a 

Counselor here at the You Seminar. 

You donÕt remember it, but youÕve 

been here before! But donÕt worry, 

forgetting the trauma of childbirth 

is one of the great gifts of the 

universe.
Joe finds a seat and watches:
COUNSELOR JERRY C 
Here at the You Seminar, all new 

souls are given unique and 

individual personalities.

Personality Profiles
 - a badge filled with circular icons 
identifying which Personality Pavilions theyÕve visited. 
On each badge one circle is still empty
.NEW SOUL 1
IÕm an agreeable skeptic whoÕs 
cautious yet flamboyant.
NEW SOUL 2
IÕm an irritable wall flower whoÕs 

dangerously curious.
NEW SOUL 3
IÕm a manipulative megalomaniac 

whoÕs intensely opportunistic.
COUNSELOR JERRY 
Oh ho! This one might be a handful! 

But thatÕs EarthÕs problem.
Joe takes this all in.
COUNSELOR JERRY 
YouÕll notice these souls are all 

missing something.
The Counselor points to the last empty circle on a soulÕs 

unfinished badge.
COUNSELOR JERRY
What goes in this spot? Well, these 

souls need their 
Spark
. And thatÕs 
where YOU come in!
CUT TO:
THE HALL OF EVERYTHING. 
The video continues by showcasing an immense space filled 
with everything on Earth.
COUNSELOR JERRY (O.S.)
Maybe you will find their Spark in 

the Hall of Everything, where 

literally anything on Earth could 

inspire!
We see a NEW SOUL shoot an arrow from a bow and become 

inspired. Their last box fills in with their Spark and the 

badge turns into an Earth Pass

A MENTOR ushers a NEW SOUL around a museum featuring moments 
from the mentorÕs extraordinary life.
COUNSELOR JERRY (O.S.)
Or perhaps youÕll prefer the ÒHall

moments from your own inspiring 

life!
The new soulÕs badge becomes an Earth Pass.
CUT TO:
BACK IN THE THEATER:
JoeÕs eyes go wide as he gets an idea.
COUNSELOR JERRY 
And just what is this Spark? Well 
as mentors, youÕve already learned 

that...
But Joe isnÕt listening. Instead, he imagines his plan:
CUT TO:
JOEÕS DAYDREAM.
In the HALL OF EVERYTHING, Joe plays a lively tune on a piano 
for a new soul. In no time, the soul is inspired and its 

badge turns into an Earth Pass! Joe smiles, not surprised.
Without a thought, Joe YANKS the Earth Pass away, tosses the 
new soul into the piano, and jumps straight to Earth.
BACK IN NEW YORK, he lands back in his stricken body. It 
jolts back to life. Joe launches out of the manhole, runs 

straight to his performance with Dorothea Williams, and 

receives the applause of the entire city.
BACK IN THE THEATER:
As the video ends, Joe smiles assuredly.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
I know youÕre all excited to get to 
work, so good luck finding the 

Spark!

The lights come on. Another Counselor steps onto the stage.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Wow, that was informative. Now itÕs 
time for my favorite part of the 

program: matching you Mentors with 

your Soul Mates!
A group of giggling NEW SOULS make their way towards the 

stage as the Counselor looks into the audience of Mentors.
COUNSELOR JERRY B 
Our first Mentor is Maria Martinez! 

Maria, come on down!
Polite applause as MARIA steps on stage.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Maria was a rare disease specialist 

from the University of Mexico.
ON THE SCREEN -- 
In a DOCTORÕS OFFICE -- The human form of DR. mARIA mARTINEZ 
successfully treats a PATIENT. 
PATIENT
I'm cured!
The other Mentors APPLAUD, impressed.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
SheÕll be matched with, one of my 

favorites, soul number 108 billion, 

210 million, 121 thousand, four 

hundred and 15.
The adorable and cute NEW SOUL steps on stage. The new soul 

and Maria embrace, giggle, and walk off hand in hand.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Congratulations! Off you go! Our 

next mentor is Bjorn T. Bırgensson!
Immediate APPLAUSE. Everyone looks at Joe. HeÕs confused, 

until he reads his name tag: Dr. Bırgensson. Joe rushes up on 

stage.

Dr. Bırgensson is a world renown 
child psychologist who was recently 

awarded a Nobel Prize!
ON THE SCREEN --
In a PYSCHOLOGISTÕS OFFICE, GRETA, a troubled teenager, looks 
at a Rorschach blot held up by a very different looking DR. 

B–RGENSSON.
GRETA
I see pain, death, destruction!
DR. B–RGENSSON 
Hmmm. How about now?
He flips it the other way.
GRETA
A pretty butterfly.
The audience of Mentors are extremely impressed. Joe forces a 

smile.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Dr. Bırgensson will be matched with 

soul number...22!
A spotlight shines on an empty spot.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
(annoyed)
Oh weÕre gonna get into this now. 

Excuse me.
Impossibly, the Counselor descends into the floor
, into 
another dimension. As Joe watches the empty stage he hears:
COUNSELOR JERRY B (O.S.)
22, you come out of this dimension 

right now!
22 (O.S.)
How many times do I have to tell 

you, I donÕt wanna go to Earth!
COUNSELOR JERRY B (O.S.)
Stop fighting this, 22. You will go 

to Earth and have a life!

Something BREAKS.
Finally, JerryÕs upper half emerges from the other dimension, 
wrestling with a soul who doesnÕt want to come out.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
22 has been at the You Seminar for 

quite some time and has had such 

notable mentors as Gandhi, Abraham 

Lincoln and Mother Theresa.
Finally, Jerry yanks 22 out of the dimension. 22 struggles in 

the CounselorÕs arms like a wildcat.
22
HA HA! I made her cry!
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Ignore that.
22
Put me down! Hey! Quit it!
COUNSELOR JERRY B
WeÕre TRULY glad to have you here, 

Dr. Bırgensson. It is an honor 

having you prepare 22 for Earth.
The Counselor struggles to hold 22 who melts in his arms like 

a belligerent toddler. 22 glares at Joe:
22
IÕm gonna make you wish youÕd never 

died.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Most people wish that, 22.
The Counselor ÒdrapesÓ 22 over Joe. Before he can protest, 

the Counselor opens a portal and quickly pushes them out.

Off you go! Bye! Bye!

The museum-like displays are filled with pop-up moments of 
Dr. BırgenssonÕs illustrious life. Glass-encased exhibits 

hold artifacts and awards while holograms recreating his 

greatest successes play on an endless loop.
22
Okay, look IÕm sure your life was a-

mayzing and you did a-mayzing 

things but hereÕs what weÕre gonna 

do. WeÕre gonna stand in here in 

silence for a little bit, then we 

go back out, you say you tried, I 

go back to not-living my non-life 

and you go to the Great Beyond.

No, look-

Thanks but no thanks, Doc. I

trouble.
JOE
Come on, donÕt you want to fill out 

your pass?
22
Ehh, you know, IÕm comfortable up 

here. I have my routine. I float in 

mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles, and 

then, like, once a week, they make 

me come to one of these You 

Seminars. ItÕs not great but I know 

what to expect.
JOE
Look kid. Can I just be honest with 

you? IÕm not Bjorn Borgenstein or 

whatever his name is. IÕm not even

JOE
Is there any way to show a 

different life in this place?
A look of suspicion comes over 22Õs face. 22 brings up a 

control panel from the ground, takes JoeÕs hand, and places 

it flat onto a scanner.
All around them, the Dr. Bırgensson exhibits vanish.

After a flourish of light and sound, 22 and Joe find 
themselves standing in THE HALL OF JOE. It dawns on 22:
22
Wait, youÕre really not Bjorn 

Bırgensson?
Joe looks around at the space. Dr. BırgenssonÕs awards, 

citations, and victorious moments have all been replaced with 

elements of JoeÕs life. 
JOE
ItÕs... 
my life
!The museum displays are comprised of much less inspiring, 

more underwhelming exhibits.
22
...umm excuse me. WhatÕs going on 

here?
22 points to a display of Binaca Breath Spray and a bottle of 

cheap Drakkar Noir cologne.
22
Binaca breath spray? Cheap cologne?
JOE
Man, who curated this exhibit?

group. Noooo!
Joe pulls 22 away.
JOE
No, donÕt look at that stuff, letÕs 

look over here!
Joe leads 22 to a HOLOGRAM -- a YOUNG JOE is being dragged 

into the HALF NOTE JAZZ CLUB by his dad, RAY GARDNER.
YOUNG JOE
Dad, I donÕt wanna go! I donÕt like 

jazz!
RAY
Black improvisational music. It's 

one of our great contributions to 

American culture. At least give it 

a chance, Joey!
Joe and 22 watch as Ray brings Young Joe into the club, where 

a PIANIST is jamming with his BAND. Young Joe locks in on the 

pianist as Joe explains to 22:
JOE
This is where it all started. This 

is the moment where I fell in love 

with jazz.
We see Young Joe enthralled by the pianistÕs playing.
JOE
Listen to that! See the tune is 

just the starting point, yÕget me? 

The music is just an excuse to 

bring out the YOU.
Joe leads 22 through more of his life.
JOE
THATÕs why I became a jazz 

musician!
But they walk up to a HOLOGRAM of Joe auditioning for an 

unimpressed CLUB OWNER.

It's not what we're looking for.
Confused, Joe walks away as 22 trails him.
JOE
Wait. ThatÕs not how I remember it 
going down. I mean I...
But they come across more rejection holograms from other CLUB 

OWNERS:
CLUB OWNER 2
Come back when you have something.
CLUB OWNER 3
Sorry, Joe.
CLUB OWNER 4
WeÕre looking for something 

different.
They keep walking through JoeÕs life, past holograms of Joe 

teaching middle school kids, sitting alone in a diner, 

waiting for a subway. 
A pathetic monument depicts him washing clothes at the 
laundromat. Joe is stunned.
JOE
My life was meaningless.
Finally, they come to a hologram of Joe in a hospital bed, 

unconscious after the fall. This is the current state of his 

body -- still alive, but soulless. ItÕs a sad end to what 

appears to be a depressing life.
But as Joe regards this, he becomes determined:
JOE
No. No no no! I will not accept 
this!
(to 22)
Kid, give me that badge. IÕm going 

back to my body.
22
Oh yeah. Sure. Here.
22 removes the badge and hands it to Joe. But it vanishes and 

returns onto 22.
The soul removes it again and tosses it into the distance. 
Again, it returns.

always materializes back onto the soul. 
22
Unless it becomes an Earth Pass, 

IÕm stuck with it.
JOE
Well what if I help you turn that 

into an Earth Pass? Will you give 

it to me then?
22
Wait! IÕve never thought of that! 

IÕd get to skip life. So yes! But 

weÕve gotta get this thing to 

change first, and IÕve never been 

able to get it to change.
JOE
Come on! I know all about Sparks, 

because mine is piano!
22 follows Joe through the Hall. They find what heÕs looking 

for: a HOLOGRAM of JoeÕs playing piano for Dorothea Williams -

- the moment that was supposed to change his life.
Joe looks at 22Õs badge, assured it will work. But still no 
Spark, the circle remains empty.
JOE
Really? Nothing at all?
22
Meh. ItÕs just... music. I donÕt 

like music sounds. It feels like a 

little too much.
JOE
Well I am not going out like this. 

WhereÕs that Hall of Everything?

Life is so unfair! I donÕt wanna 

die! Somebody call the wahhhhhh-

mbulance! Wahhhhh!
22 switches back:

I just use this voice because it 

annoys people.

ItÕs very effective.
A ball of new souls rolls past and smacks into a pavilion, 

which tips over and CRASHES on top of them.

Amazed, Joe looks around at all of the activity.
New souls are everywhere trying out different tasks from 
fishing to soccer to photography to basketball. We see some 

badges turn into Earth Passes.
A SOCCER BALL rolls up to JoeÕs feet. He kicks it, and it 
flies over to a new soul standing next to its Mentor. The 

ball hits itÕs head and the new soulÕs badge changes to an 

Earth Pass.

What can I say, Joe? Earth is 

boring.
JOE
Well what else can we do then? 

Because weÕre running out of time!
22
You know timeÕs really not a thing 

here.
COUNSELOR JERRY B (O.S.)
TimeÕs up!
A Counselor appears.
COUNSELOR JERRY B 
Nice try, Bjorn. But no need to 

feel bad. 22 can be a bit of a 

challenge.
Jerry pats 22 on the head. 
22
Even though I canÕt feel it please 

donÕt touch me.
Ignoring 22, the Counselor opens a portal to the Great Beyond 

for Joe:

So letÕs get you to the Great 
Beyond.
22
Umm, wait! We forgot to try...uh 

breakdancer! Yeah, I think thatÕs 

gonna be my thing. Popping and 

locking. Windmills. Settling my 

disputes with dance. Can we have 

one more minute to go back and try 

breakdancing? Please, Jerry? You 

look really good today, Jerry.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Oh, ok. IÕve never seen 22 this 

enthused. Good for you, Dr. 

Bırgennson!
22 waits for the Counselor to disappear before saying:
22
Run!
22 takes off! Joe follows. She runs to an opened cardboard 

box.
22
In here!
INT. CLUBHOUSE.
They emerge inside 22Õs secret clubhouse, filled with a 
collection of random items from Earth. Joe looks around in 

amazement at all the stuff.
Against one wall are thousands of name tags -- all former 
Mentors of 22.
22 opens a cabinet under a bathroom sink, revealing a 
mysterious shaft.
22
Here it is!
JOE
Where does it lead?
22
Hey, you ask too many questions. 

How Ôbout you zip it for a minute, 

mÕkay?

And weÕre going there why?
22
Because I know a guy there. A guy 
who can help. A guy like YOU.
JOE
Like me? As in, 
alive
?22 nods. 
JOE
Wait. Are you actually helping me?
22
Joe. I have been here for who knows 

how long, and IÕve never seen 

anything thatÕs made me want to 

live. And then you come along. Your 

life is sad and pathetic. And 

youÕre working so hard to get back 

to it. Why? I mean this I gotta 

see!
JOE
Okay, letÕs go.
They crawl inside the shaft.
EXT. ASTRAL PLANE.
Joe and 22 step onto the Astral Plane. Joe looks around at 
the bizarre, amazing landscape.
The glitter-like dust below their feet rises and lowers 
gently, like waves on an ocean.
Suspended above them are countless SOULS engrossed in tasks 
like playing an instrument, writing, swimming, etc. All are 

in the zone
. 
Joe is in awe.
JOE
What IS this place?
22
You know how when you humans are 

really into something and it feels 

like youÕre in another place? Feels 

like youÕre in the zone, right?

Yeah.
22
Well, THIS is the zone! ItÕs the 
space between the physical and 

spiritual.
Joe gets closer to a soul -- a MUSICIAN deep in the music.
JOE
Wait a minute! I was here! Today 

during my audition! This must be 

where musicians come when they get 

into a flow.
22
Not just musicians. Watch this.
22 picks up some astral dust, packs it into a snowball, and 

chunks it at an ACTRESS performing Shakespeare, hitting her 

square in the face.
The soul Òwakes up.Ó 
SMASH CUT TO:
IN A THEATER -- the same ACTRESS, playing Juliet, orates from 
a balcony. 
JULIET
Ay me! O' Romeo, Romeo, where for 

art thou...
She suddenly Òwakes upÓ from the zone, confused:
JULIET
Line!
CUT TO:
IN A TATTOO PARLOR -- an ARTIST is working on a CLIENT when 

22 also ÒwakesÓ her from the zone. This causes a unfortunate 

SCRATCH across the clientÕs back with the tattoo needle:
TATTOO ARTIST
Oops.
CUT TO:
BACK ON THE ASTRAL PLANE:
22 stands near a NEW YORK KNICKS BASKETBALL PLAYER in the 
zone, dribbling in for the dunk.

with this team for decades.
22 throws another snowball, hitting the player just as he 

sails through the air.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. BASKETBALL ARENA.
The KNICKS PLAYER Òwakes upÓ in mid-dunk. The ball slams onto 
the rim as he crumbles to the hardwood. The crowd BOOS.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
And the Knicks lose ANOTHER one!
BACK TO SCENE:
JOE
Alright, alright. WhereÕs this guy 

you know? I gotta get back to my 

gig.
22
Okay, okay. HeÕs usually down here.
In the distance they see STRANGE, MONSTROUS BEASTS mumbling 

unintelligibly. These are LOST SOULS.
JOE
What is that!?
22
SHHH!
But too late. One CREATURE spots Joe and 22 and runs at them.
JOE
Ahhh!
22
Run!
The creature is nearly on them when suddenly a long LASSO 

twirls around the beast, bringing it to the ground.
Joe and 22 stand frozen, unsure what to make of this.

DING DING! They see the rope is attached to a massive GALLEY 
SHIP with TYE-DIED SAILS blaring Bob Dylan music. It ÒsailsÓ 

towards them through the astral dust.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        An anchor is flung over the side, nearly hitting them. 
Aboard the ship a long-haired, eccentric captain looks down 
at them. This is MOONWIND. A gangblank is dropped. He bounds 

down it to greet them:
MOONWIND
Ah! Ahoy there fellow Astral 

Travelers! Good to see you again, 

22!
22
Moonwind! How are ya?
MOONWIND
On the brink of madness, thanks for 

asking!
22
Hey, got a request for ya.
22 nudges Joe forward.
JOE
Uh yeah. IÕm trying to get back to 

my body. Can you help me?
MOONWIND
ThatÕs what we do! We are the 

Mystics Without Borders, devoted to 

helping the Lost Souls of Earth 

find their way! IÕm Moonwind 

Stardancer at your service. 
He introduces his MYSTIC CREW, now coming down the gangplank:
MOONWIND
ThatÕs Windstar Dreamermoon, 

Dancerstar Windmoon, and thatÕs 

Dreamerwind Dreamerdreamer.
JOE
These weirdos are going to help me 

get back?
22
Just wait.
Dancerstar unwraps the now calm Lost Soul from the net.
DANCERSTAR
LetÕs get this lost soul back home.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        The Mystics seat the Lost Soul down and begin dancing and 
chanting around it. The Lost Soul continues to MUMBLE in 

incoherently.
MOONWIND
Poor fellow. Some people just canÕt 

let go of their own anxieties and 

obsessions, leaving them lost and 

disconnected from life. And this is 

the result.
(beat)
Looks like another Hedge Fund 

Manager.
As the Mystics continue the ceremony, the monstrous Lost Soul 

transforms into the soul of a HEDGE FUND MANAGER. The 

mumbling turns out to be:
HEDGE FUND MANAGER
Make a trade... Make a trade...
He looks around as if woken from a nightmare.
DANCERSTAR
Now to reconnect to your body on 

Earth.
Dreamerwind takes a walking stick and draws a circle in the 

dust. The dust falls away, revealing a portal to a trading 

floor. Through it they see the Hedge Fund ManagerÕs human 

form surrounded by computers, working a soulless job.
The soul recognizes himself:
HEDGE FUND MANAGER
Whoa! ThatÕs me. Thank you!
The soul jumps through it, landing straight back into his 
body.
INT. HEDGE FUND MANAGERSÕS CORNER OFFICE.
The Hedge Fund Manager, surrounded by screens dripping with 
numbers and graphs, Òwakes up.Ó
HEDGE FUND MANAGER
What am I doing with my life!?
Suddenly, he THROWS the screens off his desk and stands up.
HEDGE FUND MANAGER
IÕm alive! IÕm alive! Free 

yourselves! HA HA! ItÕs BEAUTIFUL!

BACK TO SCENE:
Seeing this excites Joe:
JOE
He got back just like that!?
Joe grabs the walking stick from Dreamerwind and draws 
another circle.
JOE
So this is all I have to do to get 

back to my body?
But instead of his human body, the Great Beyond appears
!JOE
AAAHHH!
MOONWIND
Ahh! Egads, man!
Moonwind quickly cover up the hole. 
MOONWIND
Joe! Are you...dead!?
JOE
No! No, no. Well, not yet. Can you 

help me get back?
MOONWIND
WeÕve never connected an untethered 

soul back to its body before. But 

perhaps if we travel to a thin 

spot... Yes! All aboard!
He leads them up the gangplank.
MOONWIND
Anchors away!

JOE
So, if your souls are here, where 
are your bodies?
MOONWIND
Well, on Earth of course!
WINDSTAR
My body is in a trance in Palawan.
DANCERSTAR
IÕm playing the saraswati veena in 

Tibet.
DREAMERWIND
IÕm a shamanic healer meditating in 

Berkeley, California.
JOE
(to Moonwind)
Mmhmm. Lemme guess, youÕre 

drumming, chanting, and meditating?
MOONWIND
Yes... something like that.

MoonwindÕs human body expertly spins a ÒHOT DEALSÓ sign on a 
street corner.

IÕm in New York City, on the corner 
of 14th and 7th.

. Get it?
MOONWIND
We Mystics meet in this glorious 

landscape every Tuesday.
They sail past high mountains, deep valleys, and HERDS OF 

LOST SOULS. Joe looks down at them.
JOE
So many of them. Sad.
MOONWIND
Lost Souls are not that different 

from those in the zone.
Moonwind points at the souls floating above them.
JOE
What?
We see a floating SOUL WITH A METAL DETECTOR, obsessed in the 

hunt. 
METAL DETECTOR SOUL
(muttering)
Gottafindit, gottafindit, 

gottafindit, gottafindit...
MOONWIND
The zone is enjoyable, but when 

that joy becomes an obsession, one 

become disconnected from life.
They watch as the soul becomes ENCASED IN ASTRAL DUST, 

transforming into a Lost Soul. ItÕs muttering becomes garbled 

and scary.
MOONWIND
For a time I was a Lost Soul 

myself.
JOE
Really?
MOONWIND

The ship sails into a sunken spot on the Astral Plane and 
drops anchor.
MOONWIND
There you are! WeÕll have you back 

in no time.
Everyone walks down the gangplank onto the astral sand.
MOONWIND
Now, since you donÕt have a 

connection to your body, you will 

have to tune back into your 

physical surroundings.
Moonwind uses the walking stick to draw a large circle in the 

dust. Dreamerwind hands 22 a tambourine and they start 

playing various instruments as Moonwind kneels down next to 

Joe.
MOONWIND
Close your eyes. Breathe into your 

crown chakra.
Joe tries to focus, but canÕt concentrate with the bad music.
JOE
Do we really need all this?
MOONWIND
Yes!
JOE
Do you have a piano on board? I 

could focus with that!
MOONWIND
No pianos, Joe! You must focus!
(beat)
Imagine silence...
(beat)
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....
Joe rolls his eyes and gives in.
MOONWIND
Now concentrate on where your body 

is. Listen for cues.
Joe concentrates. The dust in the circle swirls away, 

revealing an overhead panorama of New York

Joe peeks. The overhead view begins to fall away. Moonwind 
quickly covers JoeÕs eyes:
MOONWIND
No peeking! Maintain your 

meditative state or youÕll break 

the connection. Now, see if you can 

smell and feel where your body is!
Joe focuses again. We hear the BEEPING OF A HEART MONITOR.
JOE
I hear...a heart monitor. I can 

smell... hand sanitizer!
MOONWIND
Yes! Yes! Good!
JOE
I think I can feel my feet!

But the portal begins to drop away.

But he looks to see his own body
 in front of him, lying in 
the hospital bed.
He looks at his hands. They are cat paws

Joe peeks out from the door and down the hall. The coast is 
clear. He stumbles into the hall, struggling to control his 

new cat body.

two fumble and lurch, banging into everything.

minute!
They finally turn a corner. Joe sees the elevator. But the 

Doctor approaches, looking at a file, unaware. Before she 

sees them, Joe pushes 22 into another room.
JOE

In here!
The Doctor passes by outside, oblivious. 
They rush out and head towards the elevator. 
JOE
Now push the down button.

but the elevator call button.

livelihood!

button. The doors open.

causing a bright spot on the floor. Joe canÕt stop his cat 

instincts and tries to pounce on it. He catches himself and 

sits back down.

The CACOPHONY of New York is overwhelming to 22 -- a barrage 
of sight and sound. 22 freezes in fear, but is swept up in a 

passing CROWD OF PEOPLE.
22
Ahh!
JOE
DonÕt worry, itÕs okay. Just keep 

walking.
But itÕs too much -- A JACKHAMMER! A POLICE WHISTLE! A FIRE

donÕt stop in the middle of the 

street. Go GO GO!!!
Insistent, Joe inadvertently SCRATCHES 22.

22! I didnÕt know I had claws, 
okay? Look, IÕm sorry, but come on, 

letÕs go.
But 22 is overwhelmed.
22
Mm mm. No way. I am staying right 

here until your stupid body dies! 

Which will happen any minute now, 

because your stomach is 

earthquaking.
Joe is confused for a beat, then understands. He gets an 

idea.
INT. PIZZERIA.
Steaming slices of pizza sit under heat lamps. A cat paw 
grabs one.
EXT. NEW YORK -- SIDEWALK. DAY.
Joe carries the slice. He passes a RAT walking in the 
opposite direction, also carrying its own slice of pizza. 

They both stop, regard one another, shrug, then continue on.
EXT. NEW YORK -- DOOR STOOP. DAY.
22 watches Joe approach with the slice.
22
This place is worse than I thought. 
It's loud and bright and--

What is that in my nose?
JOE
ThatÕs

Calmer, 22 now gnaws on a gyro, making slow progress. Joe Cat

Moonwind gets back to spinning as Joe gestures:
JOE
Moonwind, listen! I gotta get out 
of HERE and back in THERE!
MOONWIND
Oh! Well weÕll have to perform an 

old fashioned astral transmigration 

displacement.
JOE
A what?
MOONWIND
ItÕs simply a way to get your souls 

back where they belong! And itÕs a 

glorious ritual indeed, full of 

chanting, dancing, and best of all, 

bongos!
JOE
I need to be at The Half Note by 7,

Woah woah woah. Not so fast! You 

must wait for another thin spot to 

open between Earth and the Astral

INT. HALL OF RECORDS.
Terry the Accountant continues to rifle through the endless 
file drawers.
TERRY

Terry slams shut a drawer and looks into the distance, at the 

millions of files still to go.
TERRY
YouÕre out there somewhere, little 

soul. And IÕm going to find you.
EXT. NEW YORK STREET -- LATER
22 turns the corner, nibbling on another slice. Joe still on 
her shoulders.
JOE
All right, this is the last snack! 

I can barely fit into my pants as 

it is. 6:30 is cutting it close. 

Too close. We gotta get back to my

BLECK! Ugh. We gotta hail a cab. 
Hold your hand out. Hold it

.22 tries hailing a cab. But they speed by, not stopping.
JOE
This would be hard even if I wasn't 

wearing a hospital gown.
A cab finally stops a few yards away, about to let out 

passengers.
JOE
Go! Go go go! Just run to that one!
22 hobbles over to the cab door just as it opens. They 

suddenly come face to face with Dorothea Williams, the cabÕs 

departing passenger. 
JOE
AHH!
Curley and Miho get out on the other side and GASP at 22. 

Dorothea looks over 22, in stained hospital gown and gnawing 

on a slice without a care. 
DOROTHEA
Is that...Teach!?
22
(mouth full)
No, itÕs pepperoni.
Horrified, Joe SHOVES 22 inside the cab, pushing 22Õs head 

down. The cab takes off.
Dorothea, Curley and Miho watch the cab drive off. Dorothea 
turns to Curley, angry.

22 and Joe step inside his small apartment. Floor-to-ceiling 
shelves against a wall are lined with vinyl, surrounding an 

upright piano. Next to it, an upright bass. Classic jazz 

posters hang on other walls. 
JOE
I just gotta get back in my body 

and really bring it tonight.
22 smells the bodyÕs armpit, then forearm.
22
How come this part is stinky, but 

this part smells fine?
Joe points to a laundry pile.
JOE
Never mind, just put those pants 

on! Sheesh, I canÕt believe IÕve

22 pulls out JoeÕs phone. Joe sees itÕs Curley. 
JOE
Curley!
Joe tries to grab it but canÕt. Instead he fumbles the phone 

all over the floor, like a cat with a toy.
Finally, the phone goes silent.
JOE
Augh!
Joe sees a ÒvoicemailÓ pop up. He pushes play.
CURLEY (O.S.)
Hey, Mr. G. ItÕs Curley. Um... I

freaked out when she saw you. And 

she called this other guy, Robert. 

HeÕs got the gig now. IÕm sorry.

barber.
22
But I canÕt pass for you in front 

of all your friends!
JOE
Dez is the only one I that talk to. 

We usually talk about jazz, but 

this time just sit there, get the 

cut and get out.
INT. BARBER SHOP.
22 carries Joe into the shop. The customers and barbers all 
give a synchronized silent Ònod,Ó then go back to their 

conversations.
JoeÕs barber, DEZ, is about to take on a CUSTOMER. 
DEZ
Hey, Joe! WhatÕre you doing here on 
a weekday? You didnÕt call for an 

appointment, man. ItÕs gonna be a 

while.
JOE
(to 22)
Aw, I was afraid of this. Go ahead 

and sit down.
22 looks for a seat. Unthinking, she takes off her hat, 

revealing the AWFUL CLIPPER DISASTER. 
Everyone reacts:
CUSTOMERS/BARBERS
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang!
DEZ
OhmyLAWD!!
Dez pushes away his customer:

You gotta wait, son. This is an 
emergency!
CUSTOMER
What?! That ainÕt cool, Dez!
DEZ
You could always let Harold cut 

your hair. His chairÕs wide open.
HAROLD, another barber, looks up from the newspaper heÕs 

reading while sitting in his empty barber chair. Through his 

bottle-thick EYEGLASSES, he silently blinks and smiles, too 

eager for a customer. 
CUSTOMER 
Nah. I can wait.
The customer takes a seat in the waiting area.
DEZ
Joe, get your butt in this chair. 

NOW.
22 sits, still holding Joe. PAUL, the customer next to Dez, 

scowls at Joe. They have a history.
DEZ
Should I even ask you how this 

happened?
22
The cat did it.
JOE
(to 22)
Stop sounding insane.
22
I mean, I was distracted getting 

ready to play with Dorothea 

Williams tonight.
DEZ
Dorothea Williams?! ThatÕs big 

time, Joe! Congratulations!
PAUL
Joe ainÕt getting no gig, Dez. You 

know heÕs Mr. Close-But-No-Cigar.
JOE
Psh. This guy.

Joe, ignore him. Now, letÕs fix you 
up.
DEZ
You keeping that cat on your lap?
22
Is it okay that I do that?
Dez throws an apron around 22 and Joe. Joe quickly pushes out 

of it, staying on 22Õs lap.
DEZ
Suit yourself. You're the boss.
22
I am?
DEZ
When youÕre in this chair, yeah, 

you are.
22
So... can I have one of those?
22 points to a jar full of lollipops. 
DEZ
Uhhh, Sure, Joe.
Dez hands one to her. She quickly unwraps it and pops it into 

her mouth, smiling.
22 
Cool. I like being in the chair.
Everyone stares at 22. Joecat chides her.
JOE
Hey, get your head in the game!
Dez fires up his hair clippers, startling 22.
22
Ah! Little chainsaw!
JOE
You need to settle down! If you 

keep this--
But FROM DEZÕS POV -- he sees a car YOWLING at Joe. He puts a 

hand on 22Õs shoulder:

Look, I can deal with some freaky 
stuff, but if this cat donÕt chill, 

weÕre gonna have to put it outside.
22
(smug)
Well, whatÕs it gonna be, kitty?
JOE
Meow.
Dez regards 22Õs reverse mohawk and gets to work.
DEZ
Sometimes change is good. You have 

been rocking that same style for a 

while.
22
Well Dez, for hundreds of years, 

I've had no style at all.
PAUL
You can say that again!
The others start LAUGHING. 22 looks around, misreading it.
22
But then my life changed.
DEZ
Oh yeah? What happened?
22
I was existing as a theoretical 

construct in a hypothetical way-

station between life and death.
FEMALE BARBER
I heard that.
DISSOLVE TO:
LATER.
22 is relaxed now, happily sucking on the lolly as Dez 
finishes.
Everyone in the store has pulled up a chair, now listening 
intently to 22Õs story.

what is all the fuss about. Like is 

all this living really worth dying 

for? You know what I mean?
CUSTOMERS
Word. Mhmmm.
DEZ
I never knew you had such an 

interesting education, Joe. I just 

thought you went to music school.
22
And another thing... They say 

youÕre born to do something,

but how do you figure out what that 

thing is? And what if you pick up 

the wrong thing. Or somebody elseÕs 

thing, you know? Then youÕre stuck!
The others nod in agreement. 
One of the customers motions to the lolly jar.
CUSTOMER 
(whispers)
IÕll take one of those.
DEZ
(chuckles)
I wouldnÕt call myself stuck but I 
never planned on cuttinÕ heads for 

a living.
22
Wait, but... you were born to be a 

barber. WerenÕt you?
DEZ
I wanted to be a veterinarian.
Joe looks at Dez, surprised by this.
22
So why didnÕt you do that?
DEZ
I was planning to. When I got out 

of the Navy. And then my daughter

Joe. IÕm happy as a clam, my man. 

Not everyone can be Charles Drew 

inventing blood transfusions.

could play in a band if they wanted 

to.

DonÕt pay Paul any mind. People 

like him just bring other people 

down so they can make themselves

Oh, I get it. He's just criticizing 

me to cover up the pain of his own 

failed dreams.
The others ERUPT with a collective ÒDANG!Ó Everyone in the 

shop LAUGHS at 22Õs inadvertent, razor-sharp comeback. 
Humbled, Paul sniffs on his way out:
PAUL
You cut deep, Joe...
22
I wonder why sitting in this chair 
makes me want to tell you things, 

Dez.

did this time.
The other customers call out:

show!
Dez heads back inside. 22 pulls out a handful of lollipops, 

showing them proudly to Joe.
22

impressed with how 22 handled it all.

TerryÕs stern face appears in his bag of chips.

Paul SCREAMS and throws the bag, running away.

operate by very different rules.

everything like that. We need to 

get somewhere. Now I suggest that-
But 22 stops over a subway grate. The blast of air from below 

whooshes up.

22 lies on her stomach on the grate, letting the wind ruffle

Joe jumps to the ground and starts pacing, thinking this 

through.
JOE
(muttering to self)
So lemme see... I need the suit 

fixed for a school band recital. 

Ugh, IÕm not looking forward to 

this. But thereÕs no reason she 

needs to know.
Meanwhile, 22 notices a BUSKER playing his guitar and 

SINGING, guitar case open to receive loose change. Intrigued, 

22 approaches.
Joe still stews:
JOE
All the times IÕve been so close to 
getting to my dreams... something 

always gets in the way. You know 

what I mean?
Joe spots 22, drawn to the music. He walks over.
22
HeÕs good. IÕve heard music before. 

But IÕve never felt like this 

inside.
JOE
Of course you love music now. 

Because youÕre ME. LetÕs go. LetÕs 

go!
22 clocks this as the train arrives. It makes sense, yet 

doesnÕt feel right.
JOE
LetÕs go!
22 watches a PASSERBY toss change into the buskerÕs guitar 

case. Inspired, 22 breaks her bagel in half and drops it in, 

too. As 22 walks away, the busker looks at the bagel, 

slightly annoyed. 
Joe and 22 walk onto the train.

Joe finds a seat and sits, like a person -- on his butt, cat-
feet outstretched. He folds his paws across his cat-chest and 

settles in for the ride like any New Yorker.
A NEW YORKER next to him looks at this, decides to scoot 
over, not wanting any part of this weirdness.
22 remains standing as the doors close. The car is nearly 
full. The train starts moving. 22 stumbles.

As the train moves, 22 has fun ÒsurfingÓ it like a wave.
22
Woahahaho! Ha ha!
22 bumps into a COMMUTER.
COMMUTER
Hey! Take it easy, eh?
22

22 quickly sits next to Joe, feeling self-conscious.
JOE
DonÕt worry about it. ItÕs the 

subway. It does that to some 

people.
22
Does what?
JOE
It wears you down. It stinks. ItÕs 

hot. ItÕs crowded. Every day the 

same thing, day in and day out.

But once I get on that stage 

tonight, all my troubles are going 

to be fixed. YouÕre gonna see a

truthful with you. Because no 

matter what I do, you disapprove.
LIBBA
Look, I know you love playing...
JOE
Then how come except for church, 

youÕre happiest when I donÕt? I 

finally land the gig of my life and 

youÕre upset.
LIBBA
You didnÕt see how tough being a 

musician was on your father. ë 

donÕt want to see you struggle like 

that!
JOE
So Dad can pursue his dreams, and I 

canÕt?
LIBBA
Your father had 
me
. Most times this 
shop was what paid the bills. So 

when IÕm gone, whoÕs gonna pay 

yours?
JOE
Music is all I think about. From 

the moment I wake up in the morning 

to the moment I fall asleep at 

night.

You canÕt eat dreams for breakfast, 
Joey.
JOE
Then I donÕt want to eat! This 

isnÕt about my career, Mom. ItÕs my 

reason for living. And I know Dad 

felt the same way.
Libba thinks about this.
JOE
And... IÕm just afraid that if I 

died today, that my life wouldÕve 

amounted to nothing.
LIBBA
Joey...!
Libba looks into her sonÕs eyes, moved and slightly scared. 

She breaks down a little, but then finally smiles.
She goes to a drawer and pulls out a large garment box.
LIBBA 
LetÕs make 
this
 work instead.
She opens it to reveal a tight, crisp BLUE SUIT.

We COME OUT OF LIBBAÕS POV as:

Joe immediately recognizes the suit, stunned:
JOE
ThatÕs... my dadÕs suit.
LIBBA
(calls out)
Lulu! Melba! Bring your good 
scissors in here. We got work to 

do!
The eavesdropping Melba and Lulu almost tip over and fall 

into the room as they try to cover their spying.
They get to work as Joe sits on a table, touched.

22 surveys the NEW SUIT in a full-length MIRROR while Libba, 
Melba and Lulu make adjustments. 
Joe watches from the side, amazed.
22
Wow. This feels 
really
 nice!
Libba chuckles. Joe watches his mom lovingly make a few 
adjustments, admiring the way her son looks in the mirror.
LULU AND MELBA 
You look marvelous! This fits 

perfectly! Just handsome! Mhmm.
LIBBA 
That is one fine wool suit, if I do 

say so myself.
22 points to a pocket-square.
22
Can I try on that?
LIBBA
Of course you can.
She puts the handkerchief square against the suitÕs breast 

pocket. 
22
Thank you... um... Mom.
LIBBA
Ray woulda been so proud of you, 

baby. Like I've always been.
Moved, Joe watches as Libba embraces 22; as Libba embraces 

him
. HeÕs awestruck at his momÕs turn.
Libba pushes 22 toward the door.
LIBBA
You heard me, right? The suit is 

wool, not polyester. 
22 picks up Joe.
LIBBA
So donÕt go putting that cat on 

your shoulders again!

JOE
Thanks, mom.
EXT. LIBBAÕS TAILOR SHOP.
Joe catches up to 22, now looking sharp in the blue suit. 
JOE 
Wow, that was amazing! Know what 
that felt like? That felt like 

jazz!
22
Yeah! You were jazzing!
JOE
Ha ha! Okay, jazzing!
EXT. NEW YORK - SUBWAY STAIRS. DUSK.
Joe and 22 emerge from the subway station in another part of 
town, in the midst of conversation:
22
IÕm telling you, Joe. You really 

should call Lisa again.
JOE
I donÕt really have time for a 

relationship right now, 22.
22
Oh, busy right now? Want to wait 

until you die a second time? Cool, 

cool.
JOE
Heh heh. I canÕt believe IÕm 

getting romantic advice from an 

unborn soul.
22

Note Jazz Club.
They run up to the club.
JOE
There it is! Ahh! We made it! This 
is going to work!
Joe admires 22 in his dadÕs suit.
JOE
Woah, I canÕt believe how good I 

look! The suit! The cut! Just look 

at me! Heehee! Boodie-be-da! 
As he looks at himself against the Half Note marquee, he gets 

more excited:
JOE
Oh, just turn a little bit! Right 

there!
22
Like this?
22 tries a few poses in front of the Half Note, getting into 

it.
JOE
Angle the shoulders. Yeah!
22
Ha ha! WhoÕs that? And from this 

side. Uh huh! WhoÕs back here? 

Still me!
JOE
ThatÕs a winner!
22
Right?
They sit. Joe admires the jazz club as he thinks on his 

future:
JOE
(to himself)
This canÕt be happening now! The 

Half Note! Look at that lineup...
But as Joe talk, 22Õs attention drifts to the world around 

them:

TWO CLOSE FRIENDS at a cafe LAUGH together.

A soft breeze lifts some fallen leaves, dancing them across 
the sidewalk.
Sunlight falls across the buildings around them. 22 looks up 
to see propellor seeds fall from a tree above. 
One falls into 22Õs hand.

22 stares at the seed. Something changes.
JOE (O.S.)
So, you ready?
22 comes out of it.
22
Huh?
JOE
To go home. Bet youÕre ready to get 
off this stinky rock, huh? WhatÕd 

you think of Earth anyway?
22 considers this.
22
I... always said it was dumb.

But... I mean... just look at what 

I found!
22 brings out a bunch of OBJECTS from the suit pocket -- a 

spool of thread, part of a bagel, a half-eaten lolly, etc.
22
Your mom sewed your suit from this 

cute spool. When I was nervous, Dez 

gave me this. A guy on the subway 

yelled at me. It was scary... but I 

kind of liked that too.
Joe regards 22, surprised.
22 
The truth is IÕve always worried 

that maybe thereÕs something wrong 

with me, you know? That IÕm not 

good enough for living. But then 

you showed me about purpose, and 

passion and...

22

Or walking! IÕm really good at 

walking!
JOE
Those really arenÕt purposes, 22. 

ThatÕs just regular olÕ living. But 

when you get back to the You 

Seminar, you can give it an honest 

try.
22
But IÕve been at the You Seminar 

for thousands of years! And I have 

never felt this close!

They look to see Moonwind approaching, carrying an armload of 

stuff, including his bongos.
MOONWIND (CONTÕD)

WhoÕs ready to go home?
JOE
Moonwind!
MOONWIND
The stars are almost in alignment! 

IÕll have you back in your bodies 

in no time.
22
No! IÕve gotta find it here. On 

Earth. This is my only chance to 

find my Spark.
JOE
22, youÕre only loving this stuff 

because youÕre in MY BODY. You can 

find your OWN thing to love when 

you get back to the You Seminar. 

Now come on, I need my body back.

Joe takes off after 22.
JOE
22, you come back here!
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET. DUSK.
Joe tries to keep up. 22 turns a corner and disappears down 
the subway stairs.
JOE
22!
But as Joe pursues, the THERAPY CAT LADY comes up from the 

same stairway, happy to see him. 
She grabs Joe and tries forcing him into her cat carrier. But 
Joe goes feral on her, a spinning ball of fur and claws.
The Therapy Cat Lady SCREAMS and drops Joe. He speeds down 
into the subway station after 22.
The pass an advertisement against the subway station wall. 
Suddenly, the linear form of Terry appears in the adÕs 

outlines.

Terry takes off after them.

22 runs towards the exit at the far end. Joe close behind. 

But suddenly they are surrounded by darkness and they both 

fall into TerryÕs portal trap.
EXT. LIMBO.
As 22 and Joe float through the inky darkness, their soul 
forms emerge out from their respective bodies.
As JoeÕs human body and the cat body float away, the souls of 
Joe and 22 float upwards, to another portal leading back into 

the You Seminar. Terry looks down on them, triumphant. 
TERRY
ItÕs your time to go, Joe Gardner.
Joe sees his body far below. He frantically swims toward it, 

making headway. HeÕs almost able to get into his own body.
TERRY
Oh no you donÕt.
Terry stops him.
TERRY
Gotcha!
Though inches away, Joe is yanked away from his body and 

pulled toward the You Seminar.
JOE
No, no, no, no, no, no!

Joe lands in the grass of the You Seminar. Above him the 
Portal closes.

Joe stops shouting.

Joe looks defeated. Terry escorts them to a group of 

Counselors.

you found them! DidnÕt expect that 

one.

It's nice to have everything back 

in order. And...
The Counselor looks at 22Õs badge, stunned.

22 looks down to see her Personality Profile has finally 

changed into an Earth Pass.
The other Counselors happily surround her.

This is a great day! After all 

these years! 
22 canÕt believe it.
22
But... what filled in the last box?
Joe seethes, lashing out:
JOE
IÕll tell you what filled it in... 

I did!
 It was 
my
 Spark that changed 
that badge!
(to Counselors)
She only got that because she was 

living MY life! In MY body!
22 starts to protest, but Terry interrupts. 
TERRY
Come on, Mr. Gardner.
Terry opens a portal to the Great Beyond. 
But a Counselor leans to Joe:
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Joe, itÕs time for you to accompany 
22 to the Earth Portal. Give you a 

chance to say goodbye.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Of course! ItÕs standard procedure.

Portal.

The Counselors encourage 22 and Joe to the Earth Portal.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Go ahead you two.
EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR -- EARTH PORTAL.
Joe and 22 approach the edge of the Portal, both angry. 22 
looks holds the Earth Pass. 
22
You donÕt know. You canÕt be sure 

why my pass changed.
JOE
Come on, 22. Think about it. You 

hated music until you were in my 

body. You hated everything until 

you were me
!22 stews. Joe turns to walk away.
JOE
Hmph, I hope you enjoy it.
As Joe walks something hits him on the back of his head.
He sees 22Õs Earth Pass lying on the ground. 

He locks eyes with 22, who stares angrily at him.

Joe picks up the pass and makes to throw it back at 22. But 
when he looks, the soul is gone. Joe looks around, confused.
COUNSELOR JERRY B (O.S.)
I have to ask...
Startled, Joe hides the Earth Pass behind his back.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
How the Dickens did you do it? Get 

that Earth Pass to change?
JOE
Oh... uh. I just... let her walk a 

mile in my shoes, you could say.

the Great Beyond.
The Counselor turns to walk away. Joe stops him:
JOE
Hey, we never found out what 22Õs 

purpose was.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Excuse me?
JOE
You know, her Spark. Her purpose. 

Was it music? Biology? Walking?
COUNSELOR JERRY B
We donÕt assign purposes. Where did 

you get that idea?
JOE
Because I have piano. ItÕs what I 

was born to do. ThatÕs my Spark.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
A Spark isnÕt a soulÕs purpose.
The Counselor walks off, chuckling:
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Oh, you mentors and your passions! 

Your purposes! Your meanings of 

life! So basic.
Joe is confused.
JOE
No... No!
He walks to the edge of the Earth Portal, watching the other 

new souls jump to Earth.
JOE
It is music. My Spark is
 music. I 
know it is!
Determined, Joe jumps down into the portal to Earth.

Joe comes to in his own body, a sea of anxious PASSERBYS 
staring down at him. He rubs his aching head, realizing heÕs 

back. 
Mr. Mittens looks on, until the Therapy Cat Lady approaches. 
The cat runs into her arms. 
Joe checks his watch and rushes out of the station.

Joe runs down the stairs, into the club. He runs into Curley, 
looking good in his own gig suit.
CURLEY

JOE
Curley, I made it! IÕm ready to go!
CURLEY

JOE
Listen, youÕve gotta give me

DOROTHEA
This is my band. I decide who 

plays.
JOE
And if you donÕt go with me, youÕll 

be making the biggest mistake of

Dorothea approaches him, unconvinced. 
DOROTHEA
Oh yeah? WhyÕs that?
Joe stands his ground as Curley listens from the doorway.
JOE
My only purpose on this planet is 

to play. ItÕs what I was meant to 

do. And nothingÕs gonna stop me.
Dorothea is intrigued. She thinks for a moment, then--
DOROTHEA
Well arenÕt you an arrogant one. I 

guess you really are a jazz player.
(to Curley)
Tell Robert heÕs out. For now.
(to Joe)
Nice suit.
Dorothea exits, saying over her shoulder: 
DOROTHEA
Nice suit.
Curley gives Joe a thumbs up and rushes off.
Joe looks in the mirror, relieved. As he straightens his tie, 
Joe notices a photograph of Duke Ellington straightening his 

tie. Joe smiles:

INT. HALF NOTE -- STAGE.
LATER -- The band kicks in. Joe doesnÕt miss a beat. He 
pounds on the keys as he and Dorothea solo joyously back and 

forth, in the flow. We see the quartetÕs tight performance in 

a series of TIME CUTS. The CROWD eggs them on wildly.
Then it ends. The lights come up. Joe is spent, breathing 
heavily, taking in the applause. He looks over at Dorothea. 

She smiles and leans in:
DOROTHEA
Welcome to the quartet, Teach!
The audience is on their feet APPLAUDING, including Libba, 

Melba and Lulu.

many like tonight.

this day for my entire life. I 

thought IÕd feel... different.
Dorothea studies him knowingly. Finally:

I heard this story about a fish. He 

swims up to this older fish and 

says ÒIÕm trying to find this thing

says the older fish, ÒThatÕs what 

youÕre in right now.Ó ÒThis?Ó says

Joe watches her go, alone and confused. The marquee behind 
him flicks off.
INT. SUBWAY.
Joe ponders DorotheaÕs words as he rides the train. It 
lurches. He bumps into someone.
COMMUTER
Hey man!
JOE
Sorry.
Joe looks into the train. SUBWAY RIDERS stand motionless, 

looking at their phones. He looks at his reflection in the 

window, feeling alone and empty.
INT. JOEÕS APARTMENT. NIGHT.
Joe closes the door behind him and stares at his all-too-
familiar apartment.
Around him, nothing has changed. He walks into the empty 
silence.
He turns on a dim lamp and sits down at the piano.

A CRUNCH of stuff in his pocket gets his attention. He pulls 
out the things 22 ÒfoundÓ: a pizza crust, a bagel, a 

lollipop, a spool of thread, and a helicopter seed.
He absently dumps it on an end-table and puts his head in his 
hand, mournfully fingering the piano keys.
JoeÕs eyes fall back onto 22Õs mementos. It triggers 
something in Joe.
JOE REMEMBERS:

OUTSIDE THE HALF NOTE, the helicopter seed twirls into his 
hand. But it is 22Õs memory. 
BACK AT HIS PIANO, Joe is startled. He looks at the pizza 
crust.
JOE REMEMBERS:

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        AT THE DOOR STOOP, Joe thoroughly enjoys the pizza slice 
moments after leaving the hospital. Again, this is 22Õs 

memory.
BACK AT HIS PIANO, Joe scoops the objects and places them on 
the music ledge of the piano, studying them. 
After a moment, he begins to play. Each item triggers other 
specific MEMORIES:
- The BAGEL falling to the BuskerÕs guitar case.

- The LOLLIPOP segues into DezÕs sharp haircut.

- The THREAD SPOOL reminds him of his mother, Libba, passing 
his dadÕs suit onto him.
Joe smiles as other MEMORIES start to flow, inspiring the 
music:
- Joe lies on the subway grate, feeling the wind beneath his 
back. 
- Watching Connie go into the zone while playing her 
trombone.
Then deeper MEMORIES of JoeÕs life emerge:

- A younger Libba gives her toddler-aged son Joe a bath.

- His father, Ray, drops a needle onto a jazz record, while 
10-year-old Joe watches. They enjoy the music together.
- A teenaged Joe pedals a bike through the park, feeling the 
freedom of summer.
- The morning light fills the streets of his Queens 
neighborhood.
- Teenaged Joe watches a Mets game from a rooftop with his 
parents. Fireworks explode against the city skyline. 
The memories bring tears to Joe as he plays. More recent ones 
start to come:
- In a diner, Joe sits alone eating a piece of pie, deeply 
satisfied.
- Joe gives a young Curley his first pair of drumsticks, 
inspiring him with a Max Roach record.
- Joe plays his piano for his ill father. Ray smiles as he 
listens, lost in his sonÕs music.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        - Joe and his mother are alone at the beach, letting the 
water wash over their bare feet.
The memories overwhelm Joe as he continues to play. He smiles 
as tears fall. Slowly his perspective alters, lifting out of 

himself, out of the city, off the Earth, and into the cosmos. 
Suddenly another memory comes, as just voices:
22 (O.S.)
Maybe sky watching could be my 
Spark. Or walking! IÕm really good 

at walking.
JOE (O.S.)
Those arenÕt Sparks, 22. ThatÕs 

just regular olÕ living.
This snaps Joe back to Earth.
 A disturbing thought takes hold. He picks up the helicopter 

seed, gazing at it as he thinks about 22. 
Joe makes a decision, puts the seed in his pocket, closes his 
eyes, and begins playing again. 
The room fades away as the music takes him into the zone
. 
EXT. THE ASTRAL PLANE.

Joe opens his eyes, now in the zone. He plays an astral piano 
in his soul form, floating above the plane. Other souls in 

the zone float on the horizon.
MOONWIND (O.S.)
Joe!? 
Joe looks to see Moonwind aboard his ship, sailing toward 

him.
MOONWIND
Joe! Good heavens, man! What are 

you doing in the zone!
JOE
Moonwind!
Joe jumps onto the deck.
JOE
I messed up. I need to find 22.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        MOONWIND
IÕm afraid sheÕs become a Lost 
Soul.
JOE 
What? How is that possible?!
MOONWIND
IÕll explain on the way.
Moonwind speeds the ship across the Astral Plane.
MOONWIND
When neither of you returned to the 

Half Note, I suspected something 

had gone wrong.
CUT TO:
EXT. ASTRAL PLANE - FLASHBACK.
Moonwind steers the ship.
MOONWIND (V.O.)
I came back here, and thatÕs when I 
spotted her.
Moonwind spots 22, now covered in astral dust -- DARK 22. He 

waves at 22. But the Lost Soul runs off.
CUT TO:
BACK TO SCENE:
Joe scans a field of Lost Souls with a telescope as Moonwind 
continues:
MOONWIND 
Lost Souls are obsessed by 

something that disconnects them 

from life. And now that 22 has 

technically lived, sheÕs become one 

of them.
Joe finds Dark 22 in the distance.
JOE
There she is!
MOONWIND
Good show!

JOE
22!
Dark 22 HISSES at Joe and rockets off.
MOONWIND
Ready the net!
JOE
IÕm on it!
Joe cocks the harpoon net and FIRES. The net wraps around 
Dark 22 like a lasso. They try to reel 22 in. 
But Dark 22 dives below the surface
, forcing the bow of the 
ship straight down into the dust.
MOONWIND
Oh no! SheÕs got us!
As the ship sinks, Joe jumps off.
JOE
Moonwind!
MOONWIND
(salutes)
A captain always goes down with the 
ship. It has been a pleasure 

serving with you--
Moonwind and the entire ship is pulled down, vanishing into 

the dust. 
CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK -- 14TH & 7TH. DAY.
Moonwind is spinning his sign. He is suddenly jolted out of 
his trance.
CUT TO:
BACK TO SCENE:
Dark 22 pops up in the distance, HISSING at Joe. The soul 
runs off again. 
JOE
22!

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        Joe chases 22.
JOE
Come back, 22! ItÕs me, Joe! 
Joe corners 22 between some astral rocks. 22 paces, animal-
like, cornered and scared.
JOE
Easy, 22! Easy. I just came back to 

give you this.
Joe holds up the Earth Pass. But 22 panics, growing more 

monstrous.
JOE
Easy...
Suddenly, 22 dives back into the sink cabinet and scrambles 

through the shaft into the soulÕs clubhouse.
Joe rushes after her.
JOE
22, listen! Come back!
INT. MENTOR ORIENTATION THEATER.

On stage, a Counselor presents a trophy to Terry, who beams 
with pride.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
And for correcting our absent-

minded mistakes and setting the 

count right, we are awarding you, 

Terry, this trophy.
(beat)
As you requested.
A few Counselors in the audience APPLAUD with varying levels 

of enthusiasm.
TERRY
I am happy to accept this very 

special award I requested, but that 

I absolutely deserve.
Suddenly, Dark 22 CRASHES THROUGH THE SCREEN and runs into 

the audience HISSING and SHRIEKING. Joe runs after 22 as 

everyone scatters. 
The Counselor quickly takes back TerryÕs trophy.

And IÕll just take that back...
TERRY
Hey!
Angry, Terry pushes through the Counselors, stopping 22 
before the soul can escape the theater.
TERRY
Oi, Noob! YouÕre not where you 

belong!
But Dark 22 grows even more, towering above Terry. 22 pounces 

on the accountant, tying TerryÕs limbs into knots. 
22 bolts out the door.
EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
Dark 22 runs through campus, Joe close behind. New Souls look 
up at the Lost Soul in wonder.
JOE
22, stop! I have something to tell 

you!
22 throws a New Soul at Joe. The New Soul LAUGHS as it 

bounces off JoeÕs face.
JOE
Ahh! Stop that! NO! 
Joe is pelted by more New Souls before 22 runs off again. 
Counselors keep the New Souls away from 22 while also trying 
to calm the Lost Soul down. 
COUNSELORS
There, there, calm down. DonÕt 

worry,You have to stop running. 

Please.
22 ends up at the edge of the Earth Portal. The Lost Soul 

looks down, scared and trapped. 
Dark 22 runs away from Joe and ends up trapped at the edge of 
the Earth Portal. She looks down, scared. SheÕs trapped!
JOE
22, stop!

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        22 looks at Joe as he slowly approaches. He holds out the 
Earth Pass.
JOE
I was wrong! Please, will you 

listen? You ARE ready to live, 22!
22 seems to calm. But suddenly the Lost SoulÕs mouth opens. 

It leaps and CONSUMES JOE!
INT. DARK 22.
Joe opens his eyes. HeÕs in total darkness. Black dust swirls 
around him. He hears CRYING in the distance. 
He sees 22 weeping and muttering in the middle of the storm.
22
(murmuring)
Not good enough. Nope. No point. I 
just need to fill out that last 

box. I give up.
Joe goes towards her, but 22 runs away.
JOE
22!
Joe follows. 
Suddenly a huge, dark version of 22Õs mentor, ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN, appears in front of Joe, blocking him. Lincoln 

appears to scold Joe, but in 22Õs voice: 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
You're dishonest! All you make are 

bad decisions! You are unwise, and 

you won't make it in the world!
Joe tries to get around Lincoln. Mentor MOTHER THERESA 

appears, blocking him again.
MOTHER THERESA
You're so selfish! No one would 

ever want to be around you!
Joe struggles forward but is suddenly surrounded by other 

mentors of 22 -- Copernicus, Carl Jung, Muhammad Ali, etc. 
All bend down to Joe, reciting their negative opinions of 22:

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        22ÕS MENTORS
The world needs remarkable people, 
and you're the least remarkable 

soul I've ever met! The world is 

better off without you in it! 

You're a nitwit! Mentally unfit! An 

imbecile! I cannot help you!
Joe breaks through the crowd, again finding 22 in the 

distance. He runs to her as she mutters to herself:
22
ThereÕs no point in anything I try. 

Why couldnÕt I fill out that last 

box? IÕm not good. Nothing I do is 

right. IÕm a loser. I donÕt do 

anything right. IÕm not good enough 

at all.
Joe nearly reaches 22, until --
A final figure blocks JoeÕs path: a massive version of JOE 
HIMSELF.
NIGHTMARE JOE
You will never find your spark. 

There's no point. Those arenÕt 

purposes, you IDIOT! ThatÕs just 

regular olÕ living. This is a waste 

of time. You only got that badge 

because you were in MY body. ThatÕs 

why you ruin everything! Because 

you. Have. No. Purpose!!
Nightmare Joe SPEWS BLACK DUST from his mouth. Joe tumbles 

away, the Earth Pass is knocked out of his hands. He 

desperately searches for it.
JOE
Ahhh! No no no no!
All seems lost, until Joe remembers -- the helicopter seed in 

his pocket. He pulls it out and walks forward, holding out 

the seed to his nightmare self.
NIGHTMARE JOE
ThereÕs no point. YouÕll never find 

your Spark Because you. Have. No. 

Purpose!!
Nightmare Joe looks at the seed, startled. He melts away, 

defeated.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        Joe finally reaches 22. He puts the seed in her hand, closing 
her fingers around it, holding it there. 22 appears to calm.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. HALF NOTE. DAY.
Suddenly, 22 is back in JoeÕs body, sitting on the stoop and 
looking at the seed, scared. 
Joe, back in the cat, looks up at her, smiling.
JOE
You ready?
22
Huh?
JOE
To come live!
22
IÕm scared, Joe. IÕm not good 
enough. And anyway I never got my 

Spark.
JOE
Yes you did. 
Joe motions to the world around them. 
JOE
Your Spark isnÕt your purpose. That 

last box fills in when youÕre ready 

to come live.
22 looks around, taking in the beautiful, simple moments on 

Earth.
JOE
And the thing is... you're pretty 

great at jazzing.
22 looks at Joe and smiles. 
MATCH CUT TO:
EXT. THE YOU SEMINAR.
Dark 22 smiles at Joe. The black dust surrounding the Lost 
Soul melts away.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        Joe finds the Earth Pass and places it on 22. 22 smiles, but 
then realizes:
22
But Joe... This mean you wonÕt get 

to--
JOE
ItÕs okay. I already did. Now itÕs 

your turn.
Joe motions to the Earth below. 
22 steps closer to the edge, but gets cold feet and darts 
behind Joe.
JOE
IÕll go with you.
22
You know you canÕt do that.
JOE
I know. But IÕll go as far as I 

can.
22 steps closer to the edge. Joe holds out his hand. 22 takes 

it and holds tight as they both jump.
INTO THE EARTH PORTAL.

Eyes shut tight, 22 clutches JoeÕs arm as they free-fall 
toward Earth.
JOE
Hey! Take a look!
22 slowly opens one eye, then both. 
The Earth slowly gets bigger as they fall toward it. The view 
is spectacular.
22
Wow! 
22 starts to enjoy the ride. The soul builds enough courage 

to let go of JoeÕs arm and hold his hand.
Hand-in-hand, 22 and Joe skydive to Earth, enjoying the ride.

22Õs Earth Pass starts to glow, slowly drawing the soul away 
from Joe.
22 looks at Joe reluctantly, unsure.

©2020 DISNEY¥PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL        But Joe smiles back, as if to say ÒitÕll be okay.Ó
Then he gently lets go.

22 pulls away from Joe. He watches the soul fall the entire 
way, and then vanish.
Tears well in JoeÕs eyes. He is pulled away from Earth and 
back up as we:
FADE TO WHITE.
EXT. LIMBO -- SLIDEWALK.
Joe opens his eyes to find he is on the slidewalk, heading 
towards the Great Beyond.
He smiles, at peace. Ready. Until:
COUNSELOR JERRY A (O.S.)
Mr. Gardner?
Joe turns to see a Counselor on the slidewalk with him.
JOE
Yes?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
Do you have a moment?
Joe walks over to Jerry.
COUNSELOR JERRY A 
I think IÕm speaking for all the 
Jerrys when I say... thank you.
JOE
For what?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
WeÕre in the business of 

inspiration, Joe, but itÕs not 

often we find ourselves inspired.
JOE
Oh, really.
COUNSELOR JERRY A
So, we all decided to give you 

another chance.
The Counselor opens a Portal. On the other side is Earth.

Hopefully you will watch where you 
walk from now on.
JOE
But what about Terry?
COUNSELOR JERRY A
We worked it out with Terry.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. LIMBO -- ABOVE THE SLIDEWALK.
Again, Terry is counting souls on the abacus. Suddenly, one 
of the beads draws her attention.
TERRY
Hmmm. ThatÕs weird.
A Counselor comes running up:
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Hey Terry, whatÕs that over there? 

Look immediately!
TERRY
What? What are you talking about?
Terry looks the other way. The CounselorÕs arm stretches 

behind Terry and slides the single bead on the abacus into 

position, covering up the discrepancy.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Oh, nothing. You were saying?
TERRY
Hmm.
COUNSELOR JERRY B
Were you even talking? I canÕt 

remember.
Terry once again examines the abacus.
TERRY
Nevermind.
Terry goes back to counting.
