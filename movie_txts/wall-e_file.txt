It blocks his way.
Wally gains alongside it, and discoversA HUMAN PASSENGER
sitting, reclined, in the chair.He is large, round and soft - like a big baby.
Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit.
The chair seems to be steering itself.
Guided by floor lines, just like the robots.
Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision.
A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face.
He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:PASSENGER #1Well, IÕve been in my cabin all morning 
so letÕs hover over to the driving range 
and hit a few virtual balls into space.PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN)Nah, we did that yesterday. I donÕt want 
to do that.PASSENGER #1Well then what do you want to do?ON WALLYHe looks over his shoulder.Passenger #2 is floating right next to them.
Isolated in his own hover chair.
Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby. 26.PASSENGER #2I donÕt know. Something.Both humans are totally unaware of the otherÕs presence.They all exit the hallway. Merge into the...ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD
Wally is in awe.Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides.
THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space.
All reclined and riding on hover chairs.
MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions.Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes.Absolutely no reason to ever get up.
No purpose.
Every one of them engrossed in their video screens.
Cocooned in virtual worlds.
Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS. 
The controls allow them to steer...
...order food...
...play games...
...and most of all......CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers:
The CHATTER is deafening.No one notices Wally at all.
He drives into the endless human traffic.MISC. FEMALE PASSENGERBot, over here!A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger.
Puts a fresh drink in her open hand.
Wally flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.MISC. PASSENGERSI canÕt hear you...IÕm in a tunnel. 
YouÕre breaking up...Oh, okay. YouÕre

A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him.
Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wally.JOHNHey, Drink-bot.Wally shies away.
John reaches farther out with the cup.JOHNHere, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!Reaches too far.
John falls to the floor.
Flails like an upside down turtle.
Unable to stand on his baby legs.Instantly, SIRENS.Wally watches TWO STEWARDS arrive.

Wally looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him. Spots Eve on the other side. 
Wally tries to sneak behind Mary.
But her chair moves backwards.
Smashes Wally against the back wall. 
No way getting past her.
Wally politely tries to get MaryÕs attention.
SheÕs oblivious.
Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:MARYDate?! (derisive snort) Don't get me 
started! Every holo-date I've been on has 
been a virtual disaster! If I could just 
meet one who wasn't so superficial. There 
are no good men out there!... Wally tries to fold back her speaker headrest.
Accidentally breaks it off.MARY (CONTÕD)...I know! I know Ôcause I've scrolled

The typing-bot responds by typing.
Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open.The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator.
Notices Wally hiding at the back.
Wally gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close.
The elevator shoots up to the bridge.The typing-bot looks at its hand.Mimics WallyÕs waving gesture.
Huh. Never done that before.
Tries it some more...INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
Wally looks out on the descending Lido Deck.Marvels at it all.
His view suddenly goes dark.
The elevator doors open on...INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUSThe large circular room is dimly lit.Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other.

A single camera eye lights up its center.
A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling.
Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes.
Auto eyes Eve. Scans her.
Wally sneaks back into the shadows.Auto detects EveÕs plant light.Goes still...
Begins computing rapidly.
The number ÒA113Ó flashes on his lens.
An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.Wally watches the interchange. Nervous.Without warning, Auto heads in his direction.

The Captain is stunned by this vision.
She opens her chest to reveal......the plant.CAPTAIN(amazed)How...? HowÕd you find it?!Eve hovers over to him.Salutes.
Formally presents him the plant.
He takes it in his hands.
Still potted in the old boot.
Gazes at it in wonder.CAPTAINWe can go back home...for the first time!(laughs)WhatÕs it like now? Eve shrugs.
DoesnÕt know how to answer.CAPTAINNo, no! DonÕt tell me! I want to see for 
myself!He turns to his console.
Hits a button.
A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel.
The Captain sticks it to the side of EveÕs head.
A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device.
Plays back images of her time on Earth.A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past.All displayed from EveÕs POV:

He looks down atHIS FOOT
ItÕs tapping in time to the music.His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands.
He lifts it up.
Makes the boot dance.CAPTAIN...You made it somehow, eh little guy? 
You didnÕt give up, did you?As if in response, the plant wilts slightly.
A leaf drops.CAPTAIN(Gasp!) Oh no, no --(remembers)Wait a minute. The Captain urgently hovers across the room.
Eve left alone.

DonÕt shoot!
She opens her chest cavity.
Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.CAPTAINEve, you are to put this plant straight 
in the Holo-detector. Gopher slowly advances towards Eve. 
But then tosses the plant across the room......down the TRASH CHUTE.CAPTAINNo!EVE(hums)[Oh no!]ItÕs over.The plant is gone.

But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam.Wally dodges AutoÕs multi-arm advances.
Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest. 
Slams it shut.WALLY(beeps)[You canÕt have it!]Auto flips open one of his handles.
Produces a TASER......and ELECTROCUTES Wally.
