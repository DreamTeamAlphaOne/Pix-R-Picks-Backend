GARBAGE CHUTE - NIGHTWoody climbs in the chute with the others and peers down.  POV -- The grimy metal chute recedes into blackness.   JESSIEIs it safe?WOODYI guess IÕll find out...Woody begins a controlled slide down -- feet first, hand bracing.  He slips and it becomes an uncontrolled slide.  He scrambles for traction, eases to a stop at the bottom.  He gets up, stands at the edge of the slideÕs precipice.ANGLE -- An alley.  The trash chute cantilevers over a half-closed dumpster.  Above him, stars twinkle -- freedom.JESSIE (O.S.)Woody...!  You okay?WOODYCome on down.  But not all at once.MR. POTATO HEAD (O.S.)WhatÕd he say?HAMM (O.S.)I think he said, ÒAll at onceÓ.NOISES.

He lands hard, clutches a metal handle.  REXHe did it!HAMMAll right, Slinky-kins!SLINKYOkay!  Climb across!Suddenly, two pink paws step in front of Slinky.  He looks up.  Lotso looms over him, grinning.  LOTSOYou lost, liÕl doggy...?Lotso kicks SlinkyÕs paws.  He retracts, falling from the lid.  The Toys pull him to safety.  Behind Lotso, his Gang hops off a wall and joins him on the dumpster lid.  Lotso notices Woody among the others.LOTSO (CONT'D)Well, well...!  Look whoÕs back!A NOISE.  The Toys turn.  LotsoÕs henchman -- Stretch, the Octopus -- clambers down the chute, blocking an escape.    The Lifer Phone wheels into view -- wheels wobbling, one eye broken, frayed phone dangling.  His voice is hoarse.LIFER(via handset)IÕm sorry, Cowboy!  They broke me...!Lotso turns to the Toys, as cheerful as ever.  LOTSO (incredulous)What are you doinÕ?!  RunninÕ back to your kid?  He donÕ want you no more!WOODYThatÕs a lie!LOTSOIs it?  Tell me this, Sheriff -- if your kid loves you so much, why is he leavinÕ?              103CLOSE ON -- Woody, fuming.  He has no answer.  LOTSO (CONT'D)YÕthink youÕre special, Cowboy?  YouÕre a piece of plastic!  You were made to be thrown away!VROOM!  A garbage truck turns into the far end of the alley and RUMBLES toward them.  Lotso turns.LOTSO (CONT'D)Speak of the devil...!(turns back)Now we need toys in our Caterpillar Room.  And you need to avoid that truck.  Why donÕt you come on back, join our family again? He smiles.  Woody seethes -- at a loss for words.  Jessie steps past him, eyes burning.  JESSIE This isnÕt a family, itÕs a prison!  YouÕre a liar and a bully and IÕd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours! Barbie steps forward.BARBIEJessieÕs right!  Authority should derive from the consent of the governed!  Not from the threat of force!Hamm and Potato Head share a glance -- Huh?  Lotso grins.LOTSOIf thatÕs what you want...!He bangs his cane.  Stretch, the Octopus, begins to prod the Toys toward the precipice.  Abruptly, Ken bursts from the shadows -- still in his underwear.KENBarbie!  Wait...!  Everyone turns.  He runs to Lotso.KEN (CONT'D)DonÕt do this, Lotso...!LOTSO SheÕs a Barbie doll, Ken!  ThereÕs a hundred million just like her!              104KENNot to me thereÕs not!He glances at her.  She sighs.  Lotso picks up Ken.LOTSOFine!  Why donÕt you join her?!He tosses Ken across the dumpster chasm.  The Toys grab him, pull him to safety.  Barbie hugs him. BARBIEOh, Ken!  Ken stands and addresses LotsoÕs Gang, earnest and heroic.KEN Everyone!  Listen!  Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair!  (points)ItÕs Lotso!  HeÕs made us into a pyramid and he put himself on top! LotsoÕs Gang eyes each other.  ThereÕs a shift in sympathy but no one wants to stick their neck out.  Lotso is amused.LOTSOAnyone concur with Ken?No one moves.  The truck RUMBLES closer -- two dumpsters away.  Lotso turns to the Toys.  His face hardens.  LOTSO (CONT'D)I didnÕt throw you away.  Your kid did.  AinÕt one kid ever loved a toy, really!  Chew on that when youÕre at the dump!He turns away.  Woody steps forward.WOODYWait...!  What about Daisy?Lotso keeps a steely composure.LOTSOI donÕt know what youÕre talking about.WOODYDaisy...?

And if you couldnÕt have her, no one could!  You lied to Big Baby and you been lying ever since!Woody yanks something from his holster.  ItÕs the rusty old pendant, ÒMy Heart Belongs To: DAISYÓ.  Lotso is stunned.  LOTSO WhereÕd you get that...?!WOODYShe loved you, Lotso...  LOTSO She never loved me!  WOODY...As much as any kid ever loved a toy!Woody throws the pendant.  It lands at Big BabyÕs feet. Big Baby stares, electrified, at the pendant -- a token of his long-lost love.  He picks it up.  His lip trembles.BIG BABYMama...!Lotso grabs the pendant.  He pokes Big Baby like a bully.LOTSO What -- you want your Mommy back? She never loved you! DonÕt be such a baby!He throws it down and CRUSHES it with his cane.  Big BabyÕs face crumples.  Lotso turns, yells at Stretch the Octopus.  LOTSO (CONT'D)Push Ôem in!  All of Ôem!  (to his Gang)This is what happens when you dummies try to think!He shoves Big Baby.  Big Baby shrinks back, hurt.  Stretch advances on Woody and the Toys.  They teeter at the edge of the precipice.  Lotso faces them, sneering.              106LOTSO (CONT'D)WeÕre all just trash, waitinÕ to be thrown away!  ThatÕs all a toy is!Abruptly, Lotso is lifted from behind by Big Baby.LOTSO (CONT'D)Put me down!  WhatÕre you doing?  Big Baby carries him to the edge of the dumpster.LOTSO (CONT'D)Help me!  Help!Around the dumpster, no one moves.  Big Baby tosses Lotso into the dumpster.  He lands in the shadows, looks up.  With a CREAK, the Big Baby tugs at the open dumpster lid.  LOTSO (CONT'D)No...!  Wait...!KLOON!  Big Baby watches -- blank-eyed, pitiless -- as the lid SLAMS down, shutting Lotso in.  No one can believe it.   REXHeÕs gone!!!MR.

(Cowboy, hurry!)The Aliens retreat to safety.  Woody tries to follow, but a pink paw grabs his leg.  Woody tries to free himself, but the paw drags him slowly into the dumpsterÕs depths.  The Toys watch, horrified, as Woody disappears. The truck turns and approaches the dumpster, fork out.HAMMOh, boy!  Incoming!BA-BOOM!  The truckÕs forks slide into the dumpster and begin lifting it up.  As it rises past the retaining wall Jessie and Buzz fearlessly jump onto the rising dumpster.  JESSIECÕmon!The other Toys follow.  Barbie tries to follow too, but Ken holds her back.KENBarbie, no...!They all try to lift the dumpster lid.  It wonÕt budge.

As the dumpster nears vertical, the lid swings open and trash begins pouring into the truck.   Woody calls out...WOODYJess!JESSIEWoody!Woody falls into darkness.  A FLASH of pink goes by -- Lotso tumbles past.  The dumpster LURCHES to a stop.  All the Toys fall into the truck.

Buzz remains behind.SPANISH BUZZSenorita!  Senorita, donde estas...?!  (Miss...!  Miss, where are you...?!)JESSIE (O.S.)Buzz...! He turns.  Somewhere in the DARKNESS, her voice rings out.

A SCRAPING sound above.  MRS. POTATO HEAD Look out!Buzz and Jessie look up.  An old TV set falls towards them.  Buzz lunges and tosses Jessie out of the way.  She turns. CRASH!!!  The TV smashes down on Buzz.  A deluge of trash piles on top, burying him completely.JESSIEBuzz...!!!As the dumpster above recedes, Jessie runs forward and begins digging.  The other Toys join her.
