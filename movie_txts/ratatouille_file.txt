A TELEVISION SET-tuned to a DOCUMENTARY. As an old fashioned World GLOBE rotates in a sea of clouds, the EIFFEL TOWER slowly comes 
into view over the horizon, dwarfing FRANCE underneath it.T.V. NARRATORAlthough each of the worldÕs 
countries would like to dispute 
this fact, we French know the 
truth; the best food in the World 
is made in France. The best food in 
France is made in Paris, and the 
best food in Paris, some say, is 
made by Chef Auguste Gusteau. We see images of GUSTEAU: cooking, signing his cookbook, in 
front of his famous restaurant. Gusteau is in his early 
forties, but his massive girth makes him look older. T.V. NARRATOR (CONTÕD)GusteauÕs restaurant is the toast 
of Paris, booked five months in 
advance, and his dazzling ascent to 
the top of Fine French Cuisine has 
made his competitors envious. He is 
the youngest Chef ever to achieve a 
five star rating. Chef GusteauÕs 
cookbook ÒAnyone Can Cook!Ó has 
climbed to the top of the best-
seller list. But not everyone 
celebrates its success. A tall, gaunt, severe-looking MAN with fish-belly white skin 
appears on the TV screen. SUPER: ANTON EGO-FOOD CRITICÓ. 
Beneath that, in italics, is his moniker: The Grim Eater.EGOAmusing title, ÒAnyone Can CookÓ. 
WhatÕs even more amusing is that 
Gusteau actually seems to believe 
it. I, on the other hand, take 
cooking seriously and no-- I donÕt 
think ÒanyoneÓ can do it... TITLES (OVER BLACK): The SOUND of wind rattling barren branches...WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS A PIXAR FILM...and we FADE IN to reveal:FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOONA light rain falls on a SMALL FARMHOUSE. The last remaining dead leaves tremble in the gusts. The quiet is shattered by a 
LOUD GUNSHOT that lights up the inside of the cottage. CAMERA 
pushes down and in toward a single window.RATATOUILLEAs we move closer, we begin to hear muffled SOUNDS OF 
STRUGGLE; furniture being bumped, dishes breaking, an 
indescribable CRASH, followed by an OLD LADYÕS SHRIEK.WeÕre close to the WINDOW now, when it is suddenly SHATTERED by a COOKBOOK. Instantly the action FREEZES.Underneath its splayed pages, shielding himself from the shards of splintering glass is, inexplicably, a RAT--REMY. HeÕs scrawny, frightened, almost comic. ItÕs hard not to feel sympathetic towards the little guy.REMY (V.O.)This is me. I think itÕs apparent I 
need to rethink my life a little 
bit. WhatÕs my problem? First of 
all--OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DUSK - WEEKS EARLIERA SILHOUETTE darts out from behind a wooden barrel, pausing upright against a blood red sky. Mangy, sinister, the 
opposite of Remy. This is how most humans see RATS.REMY (V.O., CONT'D)--IÕm a rat. Which means life is 
hard. Assured the coast is clear, the SINISTER RAT scampers out 
into the yard, followed by DOZENS MORE RATS. The RATS move 
across the expanse of grass toward a COMPOST HEAP, which sits 
in the middle of a field under the darkening sky. Resourceful and well coordinated, the rats grab bits of decomposing food and carry it off. REMY is among them, 
drearily going through garbage. 2.REMY (V.O.)And secondly-- I have a highly developed sense of taste and smell.Suddenly he catches a SCENT; which leads him to uncover a 
nearly untouched piece of PASTRY, a discarded NAPOLEON.REMY(sniffing Napoleon)Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean, 
small twist of lemon...The Napoleon suddenly erupts, and out pops RemyÕs pudgy 
brother EMILE, covered in cream and completely oblivious to 
the destruction heÕs wrought. EMILEYou can smell all that? Wow. You 
have a gift.Again the ACTION FREEZES.REMY (V.O.)This is Emile. My brother. HeÕs 
easily impressed.RESUME ACTION: An older rat, DJANGO, comes into view. He 
snorts dismissively, plucks an APPLE CORE from the compost.DJANGOSo you can smell ingredients. So 
what? REMY (V.O.)This is my Dad. HeÕs never impressed. He also happens to be 
the leader of our clan. Remy catches another scent and FROWNS; this new scent is 
different somehow, wrong. He follows the scent to Django--REMY (V.O.)So whatÕs wrong with having highly 
developed senses? Django is about to eat the APPLE CORE when Remy lunges at 
him, snatching the core from his hands. REMYWhoa whoa whoa! DONÕT EAT THAT!!3. SHED - MINUTES LATERStill holding the APPLE CORE, Remy sniffs the air, following a scent to a tarp in the corner. He lifts it, REVEALING: a 
can of RAT POISON. The other rats REACT. DjangoÕs impressed.REMY (V.O.)Turns out that funny smell was rat 
poison. Suddenly Dad didnÕt think 
my talent was useless. I was 
feeling pretty good about my gift. 
Until Dad gave me a job-- FARMHOUSE - COMPOST PILE - DAYA line of rats file past REMY, holding up rotted scraps of food so that each one passes under his nose. REMY (V.O.,CONTÕ)--thatÕs right-- Òpoison checkerÓ.As Remy sniffs with all the gusto of a lifelong DMV employee, 
the line shuffles forward with each ÒcleanÓ.REMY(sniffs before each one)Clean... clean... clean-erino... 
cleaneriffic... close to Godliness--The rat under inspection stands there, unsure as to whether 
or not heÕs been approved. REMY (CONTÕD)--which means ÒcleanÓ. You know-- 
ÒCleanliness is... close to--?Ó (no response)Remy waits, expecting the rat to get his joke. Beat.REMY (CONTÕD)...never mind. Move on...The rat moves on. Remy rolls resumes his bored inspection.INSIDE ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOONDjango & Remy stand on a beat-up chair, overlooking the rat clan as they go about their day. 4.REMY (V.O.)Well, it made my Dad proud.DJANGONow donÕt you feel better, Remy? YouÕve helped a noble cause.REMYNoble? WeÕre thieves, Dad. And what 
weÕre stealing is-- letÕs face it, 
garbage.DJANGOIt isnÕt stealing if no one wants 
it.REMYIf no one wants it, why are we 
stealing it? They continue to quarrel. ItÕs clear this is an old argument.REMY (V.O.)LetÕs just say we have different 
points of view.  ATTIC - NIGHT  Django and Emile are gobbling up an assortment of RUBBISH, which is in fact dinner. REMY watches them, appalled. He 
looks down at his own plate in disgust. REMY (V.O., CONTÕD)This much I knew: if you are what 
you eat, then I only want to eat 
the good stuff. He pushes the rotted food away. Django reacts.REMY (V.O.)But to my Dad--DJANGOFood is fuel. You get picky about 
what you put in the tank, your 
engine is gonna die. Now shut up 
and eat your garbage.REMYIf weÕre going to be thieves, why 
not steal the good stuff in the 
kitchen? Where nothing is poisoned.5.DJANGOFirst of all; we are NOT thieves. Secondly; Stay out of the kitchen 
and away from the humans. ItÕs 
dangerous. OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DUSKRemy watches the farmhouse, drawn to the warm light and the sounds emanating from inside.REMY (V.O.)I know IÕm supposed to hate humans. 
But thereÕs something about them...FARMHOUSE - KITCHENRemy carefully sneaks into the kitchen. REMY (V.O., CONTÕ)...they donÕt just survive, they discover, they create. Just look at 
what they do with food.The TV is tuned to the same show we saw in the opening. CHEF 
GUSTEAU is cooking, speaking to the camera. Remy watches.GUSTEAU (ON T.V.)Good food is like music you can 
taste, color you can smell. There 
is excellence all around you. You 
need only be aware to stop and 
savor it.Remy notices a leftover plate of FRUITS & CHEESES. He picks 
up a small slice of cheese and takes a bite. REMY (V.O.)Gusteau was right. Each flavor was 
totally unique. As Remy closes his eyes his surroundings FADE TO BLACK. A 
amorphus COLORED SHAPE appears above his head accompanied by 
a cello bass line.REMY (V.O., CONTÕ)Oh, yeah. Amazing. But... combine 
one flavor with another--Cheese still in his mouth, Remy takes a bite of the 
STRAWBERRY. 6.REMY (CONTÕD)-and something new was created.New COLORED SHAPES and musical signatures appear; swirling and dancing in harmony with the others. A light SNAPS ON, breaking the spell. The OLD LADY has awakened. Remy drops the food and scampers away. FIELD - DAYRemy follows a pleasant scent in the air. It leads him to a beautiful MUSHROOM.REMY (V.O.)So now I had a secret life. The 
only one who knew about it was 
Emile.BEHIND THE FARM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOONEmile is atop a full garbage can, rooting around under the lid. Remy calls up from the tall grass below.REMYEmile! Psst- hey, Emile--!Emile looks up, holding the remains of a brown-bag lunch.REMY(giddy)Look! I found a mushroom! Come on, 
youÕre good at hiding food, help me 
find a good place to put this!GRASSY FIELD - LATE AFTERNOONRemy and Emile walk together; Emile on all fours, dragging the enormous bag he grips between his teeth, while Remy walks 
upright, carefully cradling his mushroom.REMY (V.O.)He doesnÕt under-stand me, but I 
can be myself around him...EMILEWhy are you walking like that? 7.REMYI donÕt want to constantly have to wash my paws. Do you ever think 
about how we walk on the same paws 
that we handle food with? Do you 
ever think about what we put into 
our mouths??EMILEAll the time.REMY(he shudders)When I eat, I donÕt want to taste 
everywhere my paws have been. EMILEWell, okay. But if Dad sees you 
walking like that... heÕs not gonna 
like it.Remy SNIFFS EmileÕs BAG. His eyes LIGHT UP.REMYWhat have you got there? He disappears into the bag, RIFLES through it, emerging with--REMYCheese?? You found CHEESE? And not 
just any cheese- Tomme De Chevre de 
Pays! That would go beautifully 
with my mushroom!! And! And and and- He sniffs the air, quickly finds a plant nearby. He PLUCKS it 
from the ground, his excitement growing by the second.REMY (CONTÕD)--this rosemary!! With, maybe with-- He grabs a paw full of grass from the ground, tasting the 
milky base. Smiling, he squeezes a few drops on the mushroom.REMY (CONTÕD)-a few drops from this sweet grass!EMILEWell... throw it on the pile I 
guess, and weÕll--REMYWe donÕt want to throw this in with 
the garbage! This is special! 8.EMILEBut we gotta return to the colony before sundown or DadÕs gonna--REMYEmile! There are possibilities 
unexplored here. WeÕve gotta cook 
this! Now, exactly how we cook this is the real questi--Remy STOPS, his gaze locking on the SMOKING CHIMNEY atop the 
farmhouse roof. He GRINS.REMY (CONTÕD)--ooooohh yeah. Come on! ROOFTOP - LATERRemy has skewered the mushroom and cheese onto part of the TV antennae, which he has bent over the smoking chimney top, 
hand turning it like a rotisserie.REMYThe key is to keep turning it, get 
the smoky flavor nice and even...Lightning flickers in the far distance, followed a moment 
later by a RUMBLE of thunder. Emile watches, concerned.EMILEThat stormÕs getting closer. Hey, 
you think that maybe we shouldnÕt--KRAAAK!!! A BOLT OF LIGHTNING hits the TV antennae-- knocking 
both rats off the rooftop. They make a LONG FALL, landing 
with a THUD into a the soft dirt. Miraculously, Remy and Emile are alive, their smoking fur sticks out in an electrified frazzle. Remy holds the rod up, 
keeping the cheesy mushroom-- now transformed by lightning 
into an amazing, puffed out shape-- completely clean.REMY(moaning)Whoaaa... ohhh...(idly bites mushroom)...ohmmmmmnnn you gotta taste 
this!!! ItÕs got this kind of-- (smacks lips)--burny, melty-- itÕs not really a 
smoky flavor, itÕs a certain-- itÕs 
kind of like a--9.(MORE)(makes a sound effect)--itÕs got a--(sound effect)--kind of taste, donÕt you think? What would you call that flavor?EMILELightning-y?REMYYeah! ItÕs LIGHTNING-Y! WeÕve gotta 
do that AGAIN! Okay. When the next 
storm comes weÕll go up on the roof-RemyÕs eyes suddenly go BLANK with a pre-emptive thought. REMYI KNOW WHAT THIS NEEDS! Saffron! a 
little saffron would MAKE THIS!EMILESaffron. Why do I get the 
feeling--REMY & EMILE(together)--itÕs in the kitchen. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MINUTES LATEREmile frets, looking nervously at the old lady, still fast asleep in front of the TV. Remy RUMMAGES through her spices.REMYSaffron... saffron... hmn...EMILENot good. DonÕt like it. SheÕs 
gonna wake up.REMYIÕve been down here a million 
times. She turns on the cooking 
channel-- boom. Never wakes up.EMILEYouÕve been here a million times??REMY(resumes rooting)IÕm telling ya, saffronÕll be just 
the thing. Gusteau swears by it.EMILEOkay, whoÕs Gusteau?10.REMY (cont'd)Remy pushes aside some COOKBOOKS, revealing  a well-worn copy of ÒAUGUST GUSTEAUÕS ANYONE CAN COOK!Ó on the shelf.EMILEWait-- you.... read?REMY(guilty)Well, not... excessively. EMILEOh, man. Does dad know?REMYYou could fill a book-- a LOT of 
books-- with things dad doesnÕt 
know. And they have. Which is why I 
read. (pointed)Which is also our secret.He resumes rummaging through the spices. Emile FRETS.EMILEI donÕt like secrets. All this 
cooking and reading and TV watching 
while we read and cook. ItÕs like 
youÕre involving me in crime. And I 
let you. Why do I let you?FARMHOUSE ATTIC - SAME MOMENTRATS stream in from a crack in the wall, throwing food from the compost pile on to a heap. DJANGO is at the center, 
overseeing things. He turns away, distracted-- DJANGOWhatÕs taking those kids so long?RESUME KITCHEN - REMY AND EMILE Remy locates a tiny vial of saffron, holds it up.REMYAh. Aquila saffron. Italian. Gusteau says itÕs excellent. Good 
thing the old lady is a food lov--Something on the TV attracts RemyÕs attention; the great Chef 
Gusteau is being interviewed.11.REMY--hey! ThatÕs Gusteau! Emile, look--GUSTEAU (TV)Great cooking is not for the faint of heart. You must be imaginative, 
strong-hearted, you must try things 
that may not work. And you must not 
let anyone define your limits 
because of where you come from. 
Your only limit is your soul. What 
I say is true, anyone can cook... 
but only the fearless can be great. Remy grins, nodding in agreement.REMYPure poetry.TV NARRATOR But it was not to last. GusteauÕs 
restaurant lost one of its five 
stars after a scathing review by 
FranceÕs top food critic Arnot Ego. Remy drifts closer to the TV, drawn to the shocking news.TV NARRATOR (CONTÕD)It was a severe blow to Gusteau, 
and the great Chef died shortly 
afterward, which, according to 
tradition, meant the loss of 
another star.REMY(stunned)Gusteau... is dead?Suddenly the TV SNAPS OFF! Remy & Emile spin around to see--
the OLD LADY is awake... and WIELDING A SHOT GUN. REMYRUN!!Remy and Emile SCATTER! Emile panics, races toward the attic.REMYNO! YouÕll lead her to the colony!The Lady BLASTS huge holes in the ceiling just behind the 
scrambling Emile. He LEAPS CLEAR-- and lands on the end of a 
HANGING LIGHT FIXTURE. The old lady has him. She levels the 
gun barrel at the helplessly dangling Emile--12.REMY hides his eyes. EMILE braces for the end-- CLICK. The shotgun is EMPTY. The OLD LADY REACTS: WHAT? EMILE REACTS: Huh? IÕm not dead? REMY LOOKS UP: Emile is still 
alive? The OLD LADY curses, ejecting the shells. EMILE SEES his opportunity, starts SCRAMBLING to pull himself up onto the light. THE OLD LADY SEES THIS and rushes for more 
shells. REMY sees an opening and takes off to help Emile.Rifling through her desk drawers, the OLD LADY SPIES REMY coming out of hiding to help EMILE. She REDOUBLES HER EFFORTS 
to find a box of shells--EMILE struggles his fat body up to the precarious LIGHT FIXTURE.EMILEHelp!  Remy!  Help!REMYEmile, start swinging the light!  
IÕll try to grab you!OLD LADY hears Remy calling for Emile, but from her POV all 
we hear is a SQUEAKING SOUND. OLD LADY finds a SHELL BOX: 
EMPTY. She YANKS OPEN another desk drawer.REMY arrives at the light fixture, reaches out for EMILE--REMYEmile!  Swing to me!OLD LADY-- nothing in the drawer, she decides to look in the book shelf, LOOKING BACK to see if the TWO RATS are still 
together and struggling, still sitting ducks--Finding no shells in the desk, the LADY goes for the cabinet, LOOKING BACK to the TWO sitting duck RATS. The lady FINDS a 
fresh box of SHELLS, spilling them in her excitement--REMY STRAINS to lift EMILE. The LADY drops to her knees, picks up a shell, loading it as EMILEÕs feet get purchase. 
The LADY chambers her SHELL and SWINGS the SHOTGUN AROUND--The RATS scramble up into a new blast hole at the base of a hanging fixture. It EXPLODES in buckshot! SILENCE... then a loud CRACK--
The lady LOOKS UP: a large FISSURE snakes across the ceiling, connecting the wide circle of SHOTGUN HOLES-13.--a massive CHUNK OF CEILING breaks free and comes crashing down-- bringing with it the FLOOR of the ATTIC above, its 
furniture, and HUNDREDS OF SURPRISED RATS.The Old Lady FREAKS! She runs from the room.DJANGOEVACUATE!!! EVERYONE TO THE BOATS!RATS grab assorted belongings as they make their escape. Remy and Emile run with the terrified mob. Suddenly, Remy stops, 
looks back to GusteauÕs COOKBOOK--REMYThe book!--and TURNS BACK, rushing into the flood of fleeing rats! OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSERATS are diving out the windows, streaming through cracks, racing across the grass to the banks of a nearby stream.BY THE STREAMThe rats run into the tall grass, pulling aside camouflage, REVEALING several WATERCRAFT built from junk. The RATS push 
them into the water and climb aboard. DJANGO urges them on.DJANGOGO GO GO! MOVE MOVE MOVE!INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE KITCHENRemy, the last remaining rat, struggles with GUSTEAUÕS COOKBOOK. A strange BREATHING SOUND causes him to look up: 
the LADY is back, now sporting a World War 2 GASMASK, and GAS 
CANNISTER. She starts after Remy, SPRAYING GAS everywhere. With a burst of adrenaline Remy hoists the COOKBOOK onto his back and makes a running LEAP through the window--OUTSIDE THE FARMOUSE--and lands on the lawn in a shower of glass. It appears the COOKBOOK itself is struggling to catch up to the fleeing rats-REMYWait!  Wait for me!14.ON THE RIVERRAIN starts to fall. The last RAT BOAT has shoved off from shore, but DJANGOÕs boat lingers under the FOOTBRIDGE.DJANGOEverybody here? We have everybody? 
Wait a minute- whereÕs Remy?!At the shore, Remy throws the book into the water and starts 
paddling toward the tunnel after the colony.REMY Right here! IÕm coming! IÕm coming!DJANGOHold on son!(to other rats)Give him something to grab on to!GIT, a huge, muscular lab rat, grabs a SPATULA and hoists it 
out over the water toward Remy.DJANGO (CONT'D)Come on boy!Remy reaches out, desperately paddling with his other paw.DJANGO (CONT'D)Paddle son! Come on, reach for it! 
You can do it!Remy has almost reached the end of the spatula-- BLAM!  A BLAST hits the water, sends Remy flying backward. The OLD LADY has taken position at the footbridge above. She FIRES at 
DjangoÕs boat-- missing as his boat enters the tunnel.DJANGORemy!REMYDad!DJANGOCome on, you can make it! You can 
make it!Remy climbs back aboard the cookbook and PADDLES into the 
drainpipe before the LADY can get off a shot. She CURSES.15. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUSRemy paddles. Ahead, DjangoÕs BOAT vanishes into the dark.REMYGuys wait!  Stop! Hold up! Wait for me! Hold UP!Frightened SHOUTS echo into SILENCE.REMYDAD??(no response)Dad...?Silence. Remy strains to see into the darkness. He begins to 
make out SHAPES; the channel forking into TWO TUNNELS. REMYWhich way...?He paddles towards the right tunnel, changes his mind, veers 
toward the left. He paddles, picking up speed. Then he hears----a LOW RUMBLE. He stops, suddenly alert. The rumble becomes a ROAR. Remy whirls, PADDLES furiously the opposite 
direction. HeÕs headed toward the edge of a waterfall! But itÕs too late. Over the edge go Remy and the COOKBOOK, tumbling into the rapids below.Remy is tossed about like a rag doll, buffeted in every direction by the churning water. He struggles for air----finally breaking the surface, he GULPS a breath--
--and is PLUNGED back under. The stone walls blur past him as he claws back to the surface. Through the tumult he spies his 
one chance up ahead-- the COOKBOOK. He swims toward it, 
finally catching it, he pulls himself aboard.The rapids pass, the waters become calm. He looks back, amazed heÕs still alive. He collapses, exhausted. DISSOLVE TO:SOMEWHERE IN THE SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHTA soaked and exhausted Remy has pulled his battered cookbook to the sewer bank. ItÕs dark and cold, it smells bad, but 
heÕs safe. Maybe the clan will find him. He waits.16.LATERThe COOKBOOK has dried out a bit, and there is just enough light seeping through a grate above for Remy to read it. REMY (V.O.)I waited. For a sound... a voice... 
a sign. Something...Remy flips a crinkled page, to a appetizing photo of pastry. 
His stomach GROWLS. He looks away, turning to a drawing of 
GUSTEAU on the opposite page. The ILLUSTRATION comes to life; speaking to Remy--GUSTEAU If you are hungry, go up and look around, Remy. Why do you wait and 
mope? REMYIÕve just lost my family. All my 
friends. Probably forever.GUSTEAU How do you know?REMYWell, I--(what is he doing?)You... are an illustration. Why am 
I talking to you?GUSTEAU (shrugs)You just lost your family. All your 
friends. You are lonely. REMYYeah, well, youÕre dead.GUSTEAU Ah... but that is no match for 
wishful thinking. If you focus on 
what youÕve left behind you will 
never be able to see what lies 
ahead. Now go up and look around.Remy looks up, considering the streets above. He looks back 
to the illustration. Gusteau has resumed his frozen pose. 
Remy decides to go.17.WE FOLLOW REMYas he scurries up into a BUILDING-- between walls, through pipes, under floors,allowing GLIMPSES into the HUMAN world 
around him. Remy moves through a crack, emerges into--APARTMENT KITCHEN In the next room A PARTY is in progress. Remy spies a loaf of BREAD. Famished, he grabs it, prepares to take a bite when- --a SPRITE in the form of GUSTEAU appears, smaller than Remy, glowing and semi-transparent.GUSTEAUWhat are you doing?!!REMY(startled, defensive)IÕm hungry! I donÕt know where I am 
and I donÕt know when IÕll find 
food again...GUSTEAURemy. You are better than that. You 
are a cook! Cooks make. Thieves 
take. You are not a thief.REMY(reconsidering)But I am hungry...GUSTEAUFood will come, Remy. Food always 
comes to those who love to cook...The GUSTEAU SPRITE VANISHES. Remy shakes it off. He puts the 
bread down, denying his growing hunger, and moves on.BETWEEN THE WALLSRemy MOVES, following his exceptional nose. We see glimpses of many French lives; A PAINTER carefully paints a nude model we canÕt see--
An DOG barks aggressively, warning Remy away from his flat--
A LOVERS QUARREL. Remy watches from above, through a crack in the ceiling; SHE shakily waves a pistol at a defiant HE.18.QUARRELING WOMANYou think I am playing, Francois? You think I am PLAYING??QUARRELING MANYou donÕt have the guts!Losing interest, Remy moves on. A BULLET splinters the floor 
in front of him. Remy rushes back to the crack and SEES-- --the couple struggling with the smoking gun. The MAN wrenches it free, it clatters to the floor. They glare at 
each other, blood in their eyes-- --and KISS. Remy rolls his eyes and moves on, through dark, tight spaces... into a pipe and emerges onto--OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - ROOFTOPS - DUSKCAMERA follows as Remy scampers along railings and ledges, past windows, up vines, BOOMING UP as the ROOFTOP FALLS AWAY 
TO REVEAL--A STUNNING PANORAMA; PARIS AT NIGHT. 
It is GORGEOUS-- a vast, luminous jewel. Remy is GOBSMACKED.REMYParis? All this time IÕve been underneath PARIS? ItÕs beautiful.RemyÕs takes in the sea of shimmering lights... then sees a 
HUGE SIGN atop a building several blocks away. ItÕs GUSTEAU-- 
a frying pan in each hand. The SIGN marvels at the panorama.GUSTEAU SIGNThe MOST beautiful.REMYGusteauÕs? Your restaurant?? YouÕve 
led me to your restaurant!GUSTEAU SIGN(not entirely sure)It seems as though I have. Yes. 
There it is! I have led you to it!REMYI gotta see this...Remy heads off toward the restaurant.19.KITCHEN - GUSTEAUÕS RESTAURANTWAITERS and COOKS bustle back and forth preparing elaborate meals with energetic precision; the complex dance of Haute 
Cuisine. Professional cooking at its finest. While the COOKS range wildly in age and nationality, only one is female; a French cook in her late twenties named COLETTE.A small, nasty-looking MAN sporting a thin mustache and a toque almost as large as the rest of him, ENTERS. This is the 
head Chef, SKINNER. Several COOKS call out greetings to him. 
He looks annoyed as LA ROUSSE nudges him.LA ROUSSEHey boss! Look whoÕs here! This is 
Linguini, RenataÕs little boy. La Rousse gestures to LINGUINI, a gawky young man with a 
unruly mop of red hair sitting on a stool in the corner. He 
jumps up and awkwardly approaches Skinner.LA ROUSSE (CONTÕD)All grown up, eh? You remember 
Renata, GusteauÕs old flame?SKINNER(distracted)Ahh yes. How are you, uh...LA ROUSSE Linguini.SKINNERYes. Linguini. So nice of you to 
visit. How is--?LINGUINIMy mother.SKINNERYes.LA ROUSSERenata.SKINNER(impatient)Yes. Renata. How is she?20.LINGUINIGood. Well, not g-- sheÕs been better... I mean, uh...HORSTShe died.SKINNEROh. IÕm sorry.LINGUINIDonÕt be. She believed in heaven so 
sheÕs... covered...(awkward)...you know. Afterlife wise. Skinner stares at Linguini for a long, perplexed moment. 
Linguini suddenly hands a sealed envelope to him.SKINNERWhatÕs this?LINGUINIShe left it for you. I think she 
hoped it would help. Me. Get a job. 
Here--?LA ROUSSEOf course, Gusteau wouldnÕt 
hesitate. Any son of RenataÕs--SKINNER(cutting him off)Yes. Well, we could file this, and 
if something suitable opens up--LA ROUSSEWeÕve already hired him.SKINNER(outraged)What?! How dare you hire someone 
without my-HORSTWe needed a garbage boy.Skinner processes this, calming as he does.SKINNEROh. Garbage. Well... (to Linguini, thin smile)...IÕm glad it worked out.21.Skinner disappears into his office, which once belonged to the great Gusteau himself. Linguini turns back to the other 
cooks, who are already handing him his work clothes.ROOFTOP - ABOVE GUSTEAUÕS KITCHEN - MINUTES LATERRemy and the Gusteau sprite look down through the SKYLIGHT into GUSTEAUÕS kitchen. Remy watches, rapt as the CHEFS 
scurry about, preparing the gourmet meals.REMYI canÕt believe it. A real gourmet 
kitchen and I get to watch.GUSTEAUYouÕve read my book. Let us see how 
much you know.  Which is the Chef?Remy points out SKINNER, who is berating another cook.REMYThat guy.GUSTEAUVery good. Who is next in command?REMYThe Sous Chef... there.(points out HORST)The Sous is responsible for the 
kitchen when the ChefÕs not there. REMYÕS POV: ISOLATING THE COOKS as Remy points them out.REMY (O.C.)Saucier; in charge of sauces, very 
important. Chef de Partie, Demi-
Chef de Partie-- both important...(pointing)Commis, Commis, Commis... theyÕre 
cooks. Very important.GUSTEAUYou are a clever rat. Now-- who is 
that?Gusteau is pointing at the garbage boy LINGUINI, who is 
clumsily steering a mop and bucket through the kitchen.REMYOh... him? HeÕs nobody. 22.GUSTEAUNot nobody. He is part of the kitchen.REMY(dismissive)HeÕs a Plongeur or something. 
Washes dishes or takes out the 
garbage. He doesnÕt cook.GUSTEAUBut he could.Below, LINGUINI accidentally knocks over the pot of soup, 
spilling it. Remy gives Gusteau a patronizing chuckle.REMYNo.What WE SEE, but Remy doesnÕt: desperate that no one notices his mistake, Linguini quickly replaces the pot on the burner, 
and MOPS up the floor.GUSTEAUHow do you know? What do I always 
say? ÒAnyone can cookÓ.REMYWell, yeah. Anyone can. That doesnÕt mean that anyone should.GUSTEAUWell that is not stopping him. See? Remy watches aghast as Linguini quickly chums some water from 
another pot into the soup to refill it to itÕs former level, 
haphazardly throws in a few spices and vegetables. REMYNo! This is terrible! HeÕs ruining the soup! And nobodyÕs noticing?! 
ItÕs your restaurant! Do something!GUSTEAUWhat can I do? I am a figment of 
your imagination-REMYBut HEÕS RUINING THE SOUP! WeÕve 
got to tell someone that heÕs R-The skylight suddenly gives way, and Remy PLUNGES down--23.GUSTEAUÕS KITCHENWith a SPLASH Remy lands in a sink filled with soapy dishwater. He paddles to the surface, climbs onto the counter 
and tumbles over the edge, hitting the floor with a SPLAT.KITCHEN FLOOR - UNDER THE COUNTER - CONTINUOUSRemy HIDES. GIANT FEET (belonging to busy COOKS) boom by on either side. Surrounded by the enemies of rat kind, Remy is 
PETRIFIED. From REMYÕS POV the kitchen is a terrifying place; 
full of FIRE and NOISE. He runs out from under the counter. The door to the walk-in OPENS, knocking Remy across the floor and under the stove.  Above him rows of burners IGNITE.He races across a walkway, under another counter and out the other side, nearly run over by a DINING CART. REMY dives 
underneath it, using it to cross the kitchen camouflaged. Sticking his head out, Remy spots an OPEN WINDOW on the far wall: a way out! He runs for it, climbing up a dish rack to 
the counter. He is nearly to the OPEN WINDOW. He scrambles up onto a copper pot toward it, but the lid slips and he falls inside. He LOOKS UP.REMYÕS POV: OUT FROM UNDER THE POT LID--the window is MOVING AWAY.  WhatÕs happening?! WIDEN TO REVEAL----the POT is being carried away by one of the COOKS. The chef sets the pot down near a stove and exits.  As Remy heads back 
toward the window, a wonderful SCENT hits his nose. He 
SNIFFS, following it to a PAN filled with vegetables.  Enticed, he crawls inside, and it is only then that he notices the LARGE TURKEY-- moments before a COOK picks up the 
pan and slides it into the oven! Remy barely escapes before the oven door CLOSES, SPRINGING from the oven to another passing trolley, which bursts into--24.THE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUSRemy is wheeled into the plush hush of the restaurant, and pulls up to a table of well-dressed DINERS. A WAITERS HAND 
reaches down for a peppermill, grabbing REMY instead----which startles both of them. The HAND instantly RELEASES Remy, who quickly leaps on to another passing trolley, the 
one heading back to the kitchen.GUSTEAUÕS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUSRemy jumps off the trolley and hides. He looks up at the window -- REMYÕS POV --the WINDOW has been CLOSED! Linguini crosses into his view and tastes the soup. ItÕs horrible, so horrible that----he runs to the window, opens it, SPITS the soup out into the alley and exits-- LEAVING THE WINDOW OPEN. RESUME REMYHe sees his opening and runs for it, climbing a broom handle to a shelf above the stove that leads to the OPEN WINDOW.Dodging jars of spices he runs through the steam from the soup bubbling directly below. ItÕs so disgusting that-- --without thinking, he grabs a spice from the counter, throws a dash in. He starts for the window-- thinks better of it, 
adds some leeks, adds some pepper, starts back to the window----and STOPS. 
His gaze returns to the boiling pot. He looks back at the kitchen: the cooks havenÕt noticed him. He looks at the 
window: it is still open, and the path to it is clear. The GUSTEAU SPRITE APPEARS--GUSTEAURemy! What are you waiting for?REMYIs this going to become a regular thing with you?25.GUSTEAUYou know how to fix it. This is your chance...Remy considers this. Then, filled with purpose, he jumps to 
the stove top, turns the burner down, hops up to the spigot 
to add water to the soup.Quickly losing himself, Remy proceeds to remake the soup, alternately smelling, tasting and adding ingredients to it. 
He grabs a pawful of spices to toss in and SUDDENLY SEES----LINGUINI, wide-eyed and brandishing a ladle. They STARE at each other for a long moment, deer caught in each others 
headlights. Remy drops the spices into the soup.Skinner (OS)THE SOUP!  WHERE IS THE SOUP?The two STARTLE; Remy tries to run for the window. Linguini 
slams a collander over him, both hiding and trapping him.Skinner Out of my way, Garbage boy!Skinner spots the ladle in LinguiniÕs hand. He seizes 
Linguini by his collar.   Skinner You are COOKING? How dare you cook 
in my kitchen!Remy starts to push the collander toward the open window.SKINNERWhere do you get the gall to even 
attempt something so monumentally 
idiotic? I should have you drawn 
and quartered! IÕll do it! I think 
the law is on my side!(calling out)LaRousse! Draw and quarter this 
man! AFTER you put his head in the 
duck press to squeeze the fat out!As Skinner berates Linguini, LALO ladles the soup into a 
tureen, which he takes to the pass. Linguini watches 
helplessly as the waiter MUSTAFA carries his soup out to the 
dining room.LINGUINI *Oh, no... no no, ohhhh nooo--SKINNER*What are you blathering about?!26.LINGUINI*(points, dumbstruck)-but donÕt let- th-- sou... soup--!SKINNER*Soup...? *(suddenly understands)*STOP THAT SOUP! Noooo!But Mustafa is gone and it is TOO LATE.  Skinner anxiously looks through the door windows into the dining room-- SKINNERÕS POV: THE DINING ROOM--the soup is served to a WOMAN DINER. She tastes it, REACTS visibly, and motions for the waiter.  RESUME KITCHEN - GUSTEAU & SKINNERWilting, Skinner turns his building rage toward Linguini. Skinner Linguini! YouÕre FIRED! F-I-R-E-D! FIRED!MUSTAFA, the waiter, sticks his head through the double-
doors, speaking low to Skinner.MUSTAFAShe wants to speak to the Chef.Color drains from SkinnerÕs face. He sighs, heads out into 
the dining room to take his medicine. Linguini creeps toward the exit, but is collared by the Sous Chef HORST.On the counter, Remy inches the collander towards the window. Colette sticks a spoon into the soup and tastes. ItÕs GOOD.Mustafa and Skinner re-enter from the dining room, SkinnerÕs face a riot of bewilderment. COLETTEWhat did the customer say?MUSTAFAIt wasnÕt a customer. It was a 
critic.COLETTE(fearful)Ego??SKINNER(dazed)Solene LeClaire...27.COLETTELeClaire? What did she say?MUSTAFAShe liked the soup.UNDER THE COLLANDERThe GUSTEAU SPRITE stops Remy.GUSTEAUWait-- REMYWhat do mean ÒwaitÕ? YouÕre the reason IÕm in this mess!GUSTEAUSomeone is asking about your soup!RESUME SCENEThe bustle of the kitchen has STOPPED DEAD as Skinner tastes the soup. His eyes betray a truth; the soup is delicious. And 
he HATES that. He turns to Linguini, his face DARK.SKINNERWhat are you playing at?LINGUINI(totally confused)I, uhm, didnÕt-- am I still fired?COLETTEYou canÕt fire him.SKINNER(wheels on her)What--!?COLETTELeClaire likes it. She made a point 
of telling you so. If she writes a 
review to that effect, and finds 
out you fired the cook responsible--SKINNERHeÕs a garbage boy...28.COLETTE--who made something she liked. How can we claim to represent the name 
of Gusteau if we donÕt uphold his 
most cherished belief?SKINNERWhat belief is that, Madamoiselle 
Tatou?COLETTEAnyone can cook.UNDER THE COLLANDERThe Gusteau sprite NUDGES Remy.RESUME SCENEThe other COOKS murmur their assent. The turn of the tide isnÕt lost on Skinner. His face softens into an icy smile.SKINNERPerhaps IÕve been a bit harsh on 
our new garbage boy. He has taken a 
bold risk, and we should reward 
that, as Chef Gusteau would have. 
If he wishes to swim in dangerous 
waters who are we to deny him? UNDER THE COLLANDERRemyÕs totally absorbed in this conflict. A COUGH causes Remy to looks up: the GUSTEAU SPRITE gestures at the window.GUSTEAUYou were escaping..?REMYOh. Yeah--Remy resumes pushing toward the window.BACK TO SCENESkinner turns to Colette, gives her a withering smile.29.SKINNERSince you have expressed such an interest in his cooking career, you 
should be responsible for it. ColetteÕs face falls. Skinner turns to the other cooks.SKINNERAnyone else? (they look away)Then back to work--!The cooks resume their work. Skinner wheels on Linguini. SKINNERYou are either very lucky or very 
UNlucky. You will make the soup 
again, and this time IÕll be paying 
attention. Very close attention. Off to the side, REMY has almost made it to the window. SKINNER (CONTÕD)They think you might be a cook. But you know what I think, Linguini? I 
think youÕre a sneaky, overreaching 
little-(he SPIES REMY)--RAAAAT!!!REMY RUNS. The OTHER COOKS come after him. Skinner SWINGS a 
MOP at Remy, breaking dishes and blocking his escape. SKINNERLinguini! Get a something to trap 
it in!!Linguini CLAPS a jar over Remy. Seals it. LINGUINIWhat should I do now...?SKINNERKill it.LINGUININow?SKINNERNo! Not in the kitchen, are you 
mad?? Do you know what would happen 
to us if anyone knew we had a rat 
in our kitchen? 30.(MORE)TheyÕd close us down!! Our reputation is hanging by a thread 
as it is. Take it away from here, 
far away. Kill it, dispose of it. 
Go!Linguini nods and quickly EXITS the kitchenÕs back door.ALLEY BEHIND GUSTEAUÕS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTLinguini hops aboard a bicycle and peddles into the gloom, carrying Remy in the jar with him. ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHTThe waterfront, normally so beautiful, seems dark and forboding this night. Linguini slows his bicycle and pulls up 
under a street lamp near a bridge underpass. He climbs off 
the bicycle and prepares to drop the jar into the water. Remy is PETRIFIED. His heart racing, he presses his paws against the glass, staring at Linguini with terrified eyes. Linguini HESITATES... then PULLS BACK, shouting at Remy.LINGUINIDonÕt look at me like that! You arenÕt the only one whoÕs trapped. 
They expect me to cook it again!  (Remy looks up: HUH?)IÕm not ambitious, I wasnÕt trying 
to cook, I was just trying to stay 
out of trouble. YouÕre the one who 
was getting fancy with the spices! 
WhatÕd you throw in there? Oregano?(Remy SHAKES HEAD: ÒNOÓ)No? What, rosemary?(Again, Remy shakes head)ThatÕs a spice, isnÕt it? Rosemary?(At this Remy NODS)You didnÕt put rosemary in there?Remy shakes his head. Linguini SLUMPS down on the bank, sets 
the Remy jar next to him.LINGUINII need this job. IÕve lost so many. 
I donÕt know how to cook and now 
IÕm talking to a rat as if you 
actually understand what IÕm say--(sudden realization)--did you NOD?? You UNDERSTAND ME??31.SKINNER (cont'd)(MORE)(Remy NODS)So IÕm not crazy. Wait a second, wait a second. I canÕt cook. Can I?(Remy shakes his head)But you can. Right?(Remy thinks uncertainly)DonÕt be so modest, youÕre a rat 
for PeteÕs sake. Whatever you did, 
they liked it.(lost in thought)Yeah. This could work. Hey, they 
liked the soup--With an expansive gesture Linguini accidentally KNOCKS REMYÕS 
JAR INTO THE SEINE. Horrified, Linguini DIVES IN after it.JUMP CUT TO:ALONG BANKS OF SEINE - MINUTES LATERLinguini sits on a bench, soaking wet, the jar with Remy successfully retrieved and sitting next to him.LINGUINIThey liked the soup. You think you 
could... do it again?(Remy NODS)IÕm gonna let you go. But weÕre 
together on this. Right?(Remy NODS again)Okay.Linguini sets the jar down on its side and carefully OPENS 
the lid . Remy looks up at him... and TAKES OFF, escaping 
into the darkness. CACKLING as he runs, Remy LOOKS BACK at-REMYÕS POV: PULLING AWAY FROM LINGUINI--who stands forlorn and alone under the bridge. WITH REMYHe slows to a stop, moved by this pitiful sight.WITH LINGUINIHe SIGHS, defeated. Turns sadly to his bicycle. Then a SOUND: the CLICKING of tiny claws on cement. Linguini looks up-- 32.LINGUINI (cont'd)REMY, very cautiously, is coming toward him, back into the light. Remy looks at Linguini... who SMILES.LINGUINIÕS FLAT - NIGHTDarkness. we hear KEYS fumbling in a lock. Linguini KICKS the warped door a few times, opening it enough to enter, and 
wrestle his bicycle through. He turns on a light, REVEALING---a tiny, odd-shaped room; two doors in the wall; one a bathroom, the other a closet, both tiny. One window, a table 
with two chairs. Hotplate. A miniscule, ancient refrigerator. A ratty couch doubles as a bed, a portable black & white t.v. rests precariously on one arm.LINGUINIThis is it. ItÕs not much, but itÕs-(he looks around)--not much. (to Remy, shrugs)Could be worse; thereÕs heat and 
light and a couch with a TV. So, 
yÕknow-- whatÕs mine is yours. Remy looks over the new digs. He likes them just fine. LATERFast asleep on the couch, Linguini is bathed in the flickering light from an old and very romantic FRENCH MOVIE 
on TV. TWO LOVERS stand handsomely in the swirling steam of a 
soon to depart locomotive, staring into each otherÕs eyes-- HER (TV)*Are you-- is this... a dream?*HIM (TV)*The best kind of dream. One *we can share.*Tucked in to an OVEN MITT near the window sill, REMY gazes dreamily at the lights of Paris. The romantic MOVIE MUSIC 
swells, underscoring his emotions.HER (OS TV)*But why here? Why now?*HIM (OS TV)*Why not here? Why not now? *What better place to dream... *than in Paris?*Remy grins, slowly closes his eyes. Dreaming.33.LINGUINIÕS FLAT - MORNINGLinguini AWAKENS with a start. He looks up at the oven mitt--LINGUINIMorning, little Chef. Rise and sh----and suddenly realizes REMY IS GONE.LINGUINIIdiot! I knew this would happen! I let a rat into my place and tell 
him whatÕs mine is his? Linguini yanks open the refrigerator door and looks inside.LINGUINIEggs GONE! STUPID! HeÕs stolen food 
and hit the road! WhatÕd I expect? 
ThatÕs what I get for trusting a ra-As Linguini moves around the tiny alcove HE SEES----REMY,  quite pleased with himself as he cooks omelettes on the hotplate. Two places have been set at the tiny table.LINGUINIWh--? Hey. What-- is that for me?Remy nods and deftly (but with considerable effort) sets the 
large omelette onto LinguiniÕs plate. Linguini sits and puts 
a forkful into his mouth.LINGUINIItÕs good. WhatÕd you put in this? (Remy holds up basil leaf)WhereÕd you get that?Remy moves to the window and points to the roof garden of a 
nearby flat. Linguini looks down at the enterprising rat.LINGUINILook. ItÕs delicious. But donÕt 
steal. IÕll buy some spices, okay?Remy shrugs and turns to eat. Linguini glances at his clock.LINGUINIOh no. WeÕre gonna be late, and on 
the first day! 34.Linguini SHOVES the rest of the eggs into his mouth and grabs his coat. Famished, Remy opens wide, ready for his first bite 
of food, when Linguini snatches him up---LINGUINICaÕmon, little Chef!--and runs out of the apartment.GUSTEAUÕS KITCHEN - MORNINGThe cooks are circled around Colette, listening with interest as she reads a review aloud from the morning paper. COLETTEÒThough I, like many other critics, 
had written off GusteauÕs as 
irrelevant since the great ChefÕs 
death, the soup was a revelation, a 
spicy yet subtle taste experience.ÓSkinner has ENTERED, and is now stopped in his tracks.SKINNER(stunned)LeClaire...?COLETTEYes...!(resumes reading)ÓAgainst all odds, GusteauÕs has 
recaptured our attention. Only time 
will tell if they deserve it.ÓIN ALLEY OUTSIDE GUSTEAUÕS Linguini waits outside, Remy in palm, staring uncomfortably at the kitchen entrance, working up the nerve to go inside. LINGUINIWell, uhm... Aware he canÕt enter the kitchen carrying a rat, Linguini 
looks half heartedly for places to conceal Remy; under his 
shirt, up his sleeves, in his sock-- rejecting each in turn. Out of ideas, Linguini slowly opens the top of his pants. Remy looks up at him, APPALLED.35.LINGUINI(desperate)Look, I know itÕs weird and stupid, but neither of us can do this 
alone. So we gotta do it together, 
right? You with me??Remy gives a reluctant NOD. Linguini glares at the kitchen 
entrance, psyching himself up--LINGUINISo... LETS DO THIS THING!!KITCHEN - GUSTEAUÕS    The back door SLAMS OPEN. All heads swing to a slightly crazed LINGUINI standing in the doorway. He wilts a bit with 
the attention, and attempts to cross inconspicuously to his 
station, the hidden rat causing a strangely spastic lurch.The other COOKS watch with bewildered amusement.
Linguini arrives at his station and looks uneasily at the new TOQUE resting there: his new toque. He swallows, placing it on his head, and suddenly notices Skinner standing there.SKINNERWelcome to hell. Now... recreate 
the soup. Take as long as you need, 
all week if you must.Skinner EXITS. Linguini looks at his station with dread, a 
blocked writer facing a blank page. LINGUINISoup.LINGUINIÕS STATION - MINUTES LATERRaw soup stock bubbles at a low boil on the stove. Linguini stares at the variety carefully prepared of ingredients-- 
herbs, spices, diced vegetables, etc that have been and laid 
out at his station. HeÕs completely unsure of where to start.REMY peeks out from LinguiniÕs collar and examines the scene. He scrambles underneath LinguiniÕs shirt and across his 
chest, tickling him. Linguini LAUGHS. RemyÕs head pops out from LinguiniÕs SHIRT CUFF, sees Linguini reaching for a SPICE TIN; the WRONG spice. Remy 
signals Linguini to stop, but Linguini pays no attention, so--36.--Remy gives LinguiniÕs HAND a NIP. Linguini YELPS-- dropping the entire spice tin INTO THE SOUP. Appalled, Remy gives 
Linguini an admonishing bite--Linguini YELPS and CURSES, SWATS Remy in retaliation. Remy scurries to the other arm (GIGGLE) and gives Linguini another 
nip (more YELPS & CURSINGS).The OTHER COOKS marvel at the strangeness of the spastic, giggling, yelping Linguini. Visibly panicked, the 
giggling/yelping Linguini TURNS, lurching from his station to 
the food safe, and closing himself inside.INSIDE FOOD VAULT - CONTINUOUSLinguini RIPS his shirt open, exposing his chest and arms, which are covered in angry red BITE MARKS.LINGUINIAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH!!!(looks at Remy accusingly)AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH!!!(gestures at bite marks)AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH!!!Remy stares at the nearly hysterical Linguini.LINGUINIThis is NOT gonna work, little 
chef! I am gonna LOSE IT if we do 
this any more. We gotta figure out 
something else. Something that 
doesnÕt involve any biting or 
nipping or running up and down my 
body with your little rat feet. The 
biting; NO. Scampering; NO. No 
scampering or scurrying. 
Understand, little chef? (beat)Little chef...?RemyÕs gaze has drifted away from Linguini, to the shelves 
LOADED with premium food. Remy looks weak with longing.LINGUINIOh... youÕre hungry.Guilty, Linguini breaks a chunk from a round of cheese and 
offers it to Remy, who scarfs it down. Linguini, calmer now, 
straightens his clothes as he thinks out loud.37.LINGUINIOkay... the way I see it; you know how to cook. And I know how... to 
appear... human. We just need to 
work out a system so that I do what 
you want in a way that doesnÕt look 
like IÕm being controlled by a tiny 
rat chef oh WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME?

Remy, still eating, listens as Linguini pours his heart out.LINGUINI-we gotta communicate! I canÕt be checking for a yes or no head shake 
from a rat th-Suddenly the vault door JERKS OPEN. THREE THINGS HAPPEN FAST: 1) Skinner sees a fleeting glimpse of LINGUINI WITH REMY. 
2) Linguini HITS THE LIGHT SWITCH-- the room GOES DARK. 
3) Skinner instantly FLICKS THE LIGHTS BACK ON to see----Linguini standing exactly as before. But Remy is GONE.SKINNERThe rat! I saw  it! LINGUININo... a rat?SKINNER(searching about Linguini)Yes, yes-- a rat! Right next to you-(stops, suspicious)--what ARE YOU DOING IN HERE???38.LINGUINIIÕm just familiarizing myself with-- yÕknow, the vegetables... and such.SKINNERGet out. Linguini makes a hasty exit.

RemyÕs surroundings are visible through the thin fabric. He looks up AND SEES they are about to COLLIDE with----a WAITER CARRYING A TRAY PILED WITH DISHES. Remy YANKS BACK LINGUINIÕS HAIR like horses REINS, CAUSING-LINGUINI  --to jerk backwards in an impossible limbo-arch, pivoting under the tray of dishes-- --and BACK UP AGAIN, miraculously averting disaster.

LinguiniÕs shoulders SHOOT UP to his ears. Startled, 
Remy drops his arms; LinguiniÕs shoulders drop.LINGUINIWhooaah--!39.A gleam comes into the ratsÕ eyes. He JERKS the left hank, causing LinguiniÕs LEFT ARM to SHOOT UP IN THE AIR.LINGUINI(marveling)Wow. ThatÕs strangely involuntaREEE-Remy is yanking tufts of LinguiniÕs hair like a kid with a 
new toy. Linguini jerks around like a helpless puppet.Remy stops, looks at the panting Linguini in the mirror.REMY (V.O.)One look and I knew, each of us had the same crazy idea...LINGUINIÕS FLAT - NIGHT (MONTAGE: LEARNING TO COOK)  Using hanks of LinguiniÕs hair to control LinguiniÕs actions, Remy pilots Linguini(who is blindfolded to keep him from 
cheating) through an increasingly complex series of cooking 
tasks, everything from cutting vegetables to flipping crepes. During this comic montage we see Remy learning precisely how to pilot Linguini, and at the same time, Linguini is learning 
how to surrender himself to being ÒpilotedÓ.By dawn, Linguini and Remy have meshed into one finely honed cooking machine.DISSOLVE TO:KITCHEN - NEXT DAYLinguini stands off to the side, fretting as Skinner pulls a ladle of soup from a LinguiniÕs pot and tastes it. SKINNERCongratulations. You were able to 
repeat your accidental success. But 
you will need to know more than 
soup, if you are to survive in my 
kitchen, boy. Colette-- Skinner gestures to COLETTE, who watches with a scowl.SKINNER (CONTÕD)--will be responsible for teaching  
you how we do things here. Skinner grins and EXITS. Linguini crosses to Colette.40.LINGUINI(a little too smooth)Listen, I just want you to know how honored I am to be studying under a-Colette STABS a knife through LinguiniÕs shirtsleeve, pinning 
it to the table. Her voice is low, intense.COLETTENo, you listen. I just want you to know exactly who you are dealing 
with. How many women do you see in 
this kitchen?LINGUINIWell, I hah--- um--She brings a second knife down through LinguiniÕs sleeve--COLETTEOnly me. Why do you think that is??LINGUINI(spooked, sputtering)Well... huh--! I... hoo...COLETTEBecause Haute Cuisine is an 
antiquated hierarchy built upon 
rules written by stupid old men, 
rules designed to make it 
impossible for women to enter this 
world. But still I am here. How did 
this happen?Linguini burbles in a desperate attempt at nonchalance.LINGUINIBecause... you, ah-- hah...Colette SLAMS a third knife through LinguiniÕs sleeve, 
thoroughly pinning it. Linguini is truly frightened.COLETTEBecause IÕm the toughest cook in 
this kitchen. IÕve worked too hard 
for too long to get here, and IÕm 
not going to jeopardize it for some 
garbage boy who got lucky. Got it??Linguini NODS pathetically. Colette pulls the knife handles 
out with a single JERK and Linguini topples to the floor. 
Colette EXITS. Linguini peeks over the counter, dazzled.41.LINGUINIWow...SKINNERÕS OFFICESkinner watches as ad man FRANCOIS DUPUIS finishes pitching his campaign for the latest GUSTEAUÕS FROZEN FOOD product. The trademark Chef Gusteau art has been re-painted; Gusteau now sports a kimono, coolie hat, and chopsticks. Behind this 
are similar campaigns for GUSTEAUÕS FRENCH PIZZA and 
GUSTEAUÕS MICROWAVE BURRITOS. Skinner is captivated.DUPUISÒEasy to cook, easy to eat, Gusteau 
makes Chinese food ÔChine-Easy!ÕÓ.SKINNERExcellent work Francois, as usual. DUPUISItÕs good, isnÕt it?Skinner stands, offering a handshake to signal the end of the 
meeting. As Francois packs up his portfolio, preparing to 
leave, Skinner straightens the photo of himself with Gusteau 
that hangs on the wall. SKINNERI want you to work up something for 
my latest frozen food concept: 
ÒGusteauÕs Corn PuppiesÓ. Like corn 
dogs, only smaller, bite size!DUPUIS(starts sketching in pad)What are corn dogs?SKINNERCheap sausages dipped in batter and 
deep fried. You know... American.
Whip something up, maybe Gusteau in 
overalls and Huckleberry Tom hat-DUPUIS(displaying his sketch)Or as a giant ear of corn in doggie 
makeup?SKINNERYes, but... with dignity.42.Dupuis EXITS. Skinner moves to his desk and the stack of UNOPENED MAIL there, and begins to shuffle through it; bill, 
bill, bill-- and the PINK ENVELOPE given to him by Linguini. He opens the envelope and reads; his bored eyes growing wider and wider with each line. He GASPS, seizing the phone.SKINNERGet my lawyer--!SKINNERÕS OFFICE - AN HOUR LATERSkinnerÕs lawyer TALON LABARTHE is reading GUSTEAUÕS WILL. TALONThe will stipulates that, if after  a period of two years from the date 
of death no heir appears, GusteauÕs 
business interests-- including the 
restaurant and the rights to his 
name and image-- will pass to his 
Sous Chef. You.SKINNERI know what the will stipulates! (brandishing letter)What I want to know is if this 
letter, if this boy, changes 
anything!Skinner raises the window blinds, revealing a view of the 
kitchen and Linguini, who looks unusually awkward among the 
practiced cooking staff. Talon looks from Linguini to a 
framed photo of GUSTEAU.TALONThereÕs not much resemblance--SKINNER(drops blinds)ThereÕs NO resemblance at all! HeÕs 
not GusteauÕs son! Gusteau had no 
children! And what of the timing of 
all this? The deadline in the will 
expires in less than a month! Talon drifts around the office, searching for something.43.SKINNER (CONTÕD)Suddenly some boy arrives with a letter from his Òrecently deceasedÓ 
mother claiming Gusteau as his 
father? Highly suspect! Talon spies a TOQUE inside a DISPLAY CASE. He turns to 
Skinner.TALONThis is GusteauÕs?(Skinner NODS)May I?SKINNEROf course, of course.Talon carefully opens the display case, removes GUSTEAUÕS 
TOQUE and begins to inspect it.TALONBut the boy does not know?SKINNER(brandishing the letter)She claims she never told him-- OR 
Gusteau! And asks that I not tell!TALONWhy you? What does she want?Talon spies something on the toque: a HAIR. He pulls a pair 
of TWEEZERS from his coat, removes the hair, folding it 
carefully inside a handkerchief, and pocketing it.SKINNERA job. For the boy.TALONOnly a job? SKINNERWell... yes.TALONThen what are you worried about? If 
he works here youÕll be able to 
keep an eye on him, while I do a 
little digging, find out how much 
of this is real.(getting his coat)IÕll need you to collect some DNA 
samples from the boy, hair maybe.44.SKINNERThe whole thing is HIGHLY SUSPECT. He KNOWS something!! TALONRelax. HeÕs a garbage boy. I think 
you can handle him.Talon exits. Skinner stands inert, spooked.KITCHEN  Linguini finishes dicing a red pepper. He sets down his knife, carefully scoops up the small pile of dicings, walks 
over to a giant pot and drops it in, returning to repeat the 
procedure. Colette, who has watched this, interrupts-- COLETTEWhat are you doing?LINGUINIIÕm cutting. Vegetables. IÕm 
cutting the vegetables?COLETTENO. You waste energy and time!Colette slides a chair up to the end of LinguiniÕs prep table 
and slams the pot down on its seat so that the top is level 
with the tableÕs surface.COLETTEYou think cooking is a cute job, 
huh? Like mommy in the kitchen? She snatches LinguiniÕs KNIFE from him with one hand, several 
vegetables with the other. With frightening speed she dices 
them; flicking each diced pile into the pot with the knife; 
dice, flick, dice, flick--COLETTEWell mommy never had to face the 
dinner rush when the orders come 
flooding in and every dish is 
different and none are simple and 
all have different cooking times 
but must arrive on the customers 
table at exactly the same time, hot 
and perfect. Every second counts--In MOMENTS Colette has completed a ten-minute Linguini job.45.COLETTE (CONTÕD)--and you CAN NOT BE MOMMY!!!!TIME CUT: ANOTHER DAYLinguini is cooking. He takes a pan off the burner and sets it to one side, which is already cluttered with utensils. 
Colette sees the mess and is outraged. COLETTEWhat is this??? Linguini stammers. Colette quickly clears his station, 
pitching it all into a sink full of dishwater. COLETTEKeep your station clear. When the meal rush comes what will happen?? 
Messy stations slow things down, 
food doesnÕt go, orders pile up-- 
disaster!! IÕll make this easy to 
remember; keep your station 
clear... or I WILL KILL YOU.TIME CUT: Colette grabs Linguini by the arm and holds up his 
sleeves, which are smeared with multi-colored STAINS.COLETTEYour sleeves look like you threw up 
on them. Keep your hands and arms 
in, close to the body like this--(she demonstrates)--see? Always return to this 
position. Cooks move fast; sharp 
utensils, hot metal, keep your arms 
in, you will minimize cuts and 
burns and keep your sleeves clean. 
Mark of a chef; messy apron, clean 
sleeves.TIME CUT: ANOTHER DAYLinguini and Colette shell peas. ColetteÕs manner is easier, more collegial.COLETTEI know the Gusteau style cold. In 
every dish Chef Gusteau always has 
something unexpected. I will show 
you, I memorized all his recipes--46.LINGUINI(writing it down)ÒAlways do something unexpectedÓ...COLETTENo. ÒFollow the recipeÓ.LINGUINIBut you just said--COLETTEIt was his job to be unexpected. It is our job to-- COLETTE & LINGUINI--follow the recipe.TIME CUT: ANOTHER DAYColette pulls a loaf from a basket of freshly baked bread and shows it to Linguini.COLETTEHow do you tell how good bread is 
without tasting it? Not the smell, 
not the look, but the sound... of the crust. Listen--She holds the loaf to her ears, Linguini leans in to listen.INSIDE LINGUINIÕS TOQUERemy also LEANS IN to listen. Colette gives the bread a SQUEEZE. The CRACKLE is seductive.RESUME SCENEShe and Linguini SMILE at the pleasing CRUNCH.COLETTE (CONTÕD) -a symphony of crackles. Only great bread sounds this way.TIME CUT: ANOTHER DAY - EARLY MORNINGColette and Linguini have begun their prep. There is a new relaxation between them. 47.COLETTEThe only way to get the best produce is to have first pick of 
the day, and there are only two 
ways to get first pick; grow it 
yourself or bribe a grower.  She gestures to the back door. Outside a PRODUCE SELLER, 
conversing amicably with La Rousse, sets down a crate of 
gorgeous fruit and vegetables. La Rousse slips him money.COLETTEVoila! The best restaurants get 
first pick.TIME CUT:  Linguini and Colette cook side by side, their manner now as easy and familiar as old friends.COLETTEPeople think Haute Cuisine is 
snooty, so chefs must also be 
snooty. But not so. ON LALO, who bobs to radio music as he saut”s, cooking with a 
efficient, yet theatrical flourish.COLETTE (V.O.)Lalo there-- ran away from home at 
twelve, got hired by circus people 
as an acrobat, got fired for 
messing around with the ringmasters 
daughter. CAMERA SWINGS to HORST. He glances about with shifty eyes.COLETTE (V.O.)Horst has done time.LINGUINI(V.O.)What for?COLETTE (V.O.)No one knows for sure. He changes 
the story every time you ask him.JUMP CUTS: HORST explains various reasons for incarceration.HORSTI defrauded a major corporation. (CUT)48.(MORE)I robbed the second largest bank in France using only a ballpoint pen.(CUT)I created a hole in the ozone over 
Avignon. (CUT)I killed a man with-- (he holds it up)--this thumb. CAMERA MOVES to POMPIDOU. He works dough with expert 
precision.COLETTE (V.O.)DonÕt ever play cards with 
Pompidou. HeÕs been banned from 
both Las Vegas and Monte Carlo. CAMERA MOVES to LAROUSSE as he slips into the food safe.COLETTE (V.O.)La Rousse ran guns for the 
resistance.LINGUINI (V.O.)Which resistance?COLETTE (V.O.)He wonÕt say. Apparently they did 
not win.RESUME COLETTE & LINGUINICOLETTESo you see, we are artists. 
Pirates. More than cooks are we. LINGUINIÒWeÓ...?COLETTEOui. You are one of us now, oui?.LINGUINI(surprised, touched)Oui. They exchange smiles and resume work. PAUSE.LINGUINIThank you... by the way, for all 
the advice about cooking.49.HORST (cont'd)COLETTEThank you, too.LINGUINIFor what?COLETTEFor taking it.INSIDE SKINNERÕS CAR - MOVING - NIGHTSkinner listens to the radio. Suddenly he SITS UP--HIS POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:Remy scampers across the alley to the kitchen entrance behind GUSTEAUÕS... and into the hands of a kneeling Linguini.SKINNERThe rat!!RESUME SKINNERHe JAMS the brakes, throws the car into reverse. As Linguini is brought back into view we see that REMY IS GONE. Still 
kneeling, Linguini holds up a set of KEYS.LINGUINI(to Skinner, chuckles)I just dropped my keys.Skinner is BAFFLED.GUSTEAUÕS - DINING AREA - NIGHTThere is noticeably more energy and fewer empty tables in the dining room. Mustafa arrives at a table of FOOD SNOBS.MUSTAFAHave you decided?FOOD SNOB #1Well, the new soup is excellent but-FOOD SNOB #2--but we order it every time. FOOD SNOB #3What else do you have?50.MUSTAFAWe have a very nice Foie Gras--FOOD SNOB #1(impatient)Yes, the old standby, you used to be famous for it. What does the 
Chef have thatÕs new?Mustafa stands there, slack-jawed and blinking.KITCHENMustafa crashes through the swinging doors in a panic.MUSTAFASomeone has asked what is new!HORSTNew?MUSTAFAYes! What do I tell them?HORSTWhat did you tell them?MUSTAFAI told them I would ask!SKINNERWhat are you blathering 
about?HORSTCustomers are asking what is 
new.*MUSTAFAWhat should I tell them?SKINNERWhat DID you tell them??MUSTAFAI TOLD THEM I WOULD ASK!!!SKINNERThis is simple. Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe, something we 
havenÕt made in a while and--MUSTAFAThey know about the old stuff. They 
like LinguiniÕs soup--SKINNERLinguini? They are asking for food 
from-- LINGUINI?LALOA lot of customers like the soup. 
ThatÕs all we were saying.POMPIDOUWere we saying that?51.An IDEA comes to Skinner. Dark pleasure blooms on his face.SKINNERVery well. If itÕs Linguini they want... He pulls Horst close and speaks to him quietly.SKINNER...tell them ÒChefÓ Linguini has 
prepared something special for 
them, something definitely Òoff-
menuÓ. Oh, and donÕt forget to 
stress its ÒLinguini-nessÓ.HORSTOui, Chef.Skinner turns to Linguini, a big shark-smile on his face.SKINNERNow is your chance to try something 
worthy of your talent, Linguini. A 
forgotten favorite of the ChefÕs: 
ÒSweetbread a la GusteauÓ! Colette 
will help you!COLETTEOui, Chef.SKINNERNow hurry up. Our diners are 
hungry!Skinner turns to go to his office, a worried La Rousse rushes 
up to him, speaking in a low, concerned voice.LA ROUSSEAre you sure? That recipe was a 
disaster. Gusteau himself said so.SKINNERJust the sort of challenge a 
budding chef needs.Skinner disappears inside his office, humming to himself.WITH COLETTE & LINGUINILinguini looking over ColetteÕs shoulder as she stares at an old, yellowing recipe card, sizing up itÕs ingredients.52.COLETTESweetbread a la Gusteau. Sweetbread cooked in a salt crust with 
cuttlefish tenticles. Drizzled 
with...snail porridge...(with increasing distaste)Douglas fir puree... beetroot 
mousse and pollen...dried white 
fungus... and dipped in anchovy 
liquorice sauce. Huh.Sounds awful. Colette shrugs it off and turns to Linguini.COLETTEI donÕt know this recipe. But it is 
Gusteau, so-- (calling out)Lalo! We have some veal stomach 
soaking, yes?? LALO (O.S.)Yes, the veal stomach, I get that.LINGUINIUh-- veal... stomach?INSIDE LINGUINIÕS TOQUE - MINUTES LATER Remy pilots LinguiniÕs hand to lift the small pot of snail porridge off the burner and up to LinguiniÕs toque for an 
obligatory sniff. Remy looks at the porridge, then at the 
rack of fresh spices. Suddenly Remy pilots Linguini to go for 
the SPICES, lifting them rapidly one by one up the toque to 
SNIFF. Remy selects one that smells right and dumps it in the 
pot. LINGUINIsuddenly LEANS FORWARD, tilting his toque over the fragrant STEAM from the simmering pot. INSIDE LINGUINIÕS TOQUERemy takes a WHIFF, likes what he smells. Inspired, he pilots Linguini out into the kitchen.53.LINGUINI  --is alarmed by his sudden ramble, completely unsure of where heÕs going, what heÕs looking for.UNDER THE TOQUERemy maneuvers Linguini spasmodically past the other cooks stations, wildly sniffing around for the next ingredient, a 
composer hunting for the next note in a new symphony. He 
catches a pleasing scent in LaloÕs station--LINGUINISNATCHES some SHALLOTS from Lalo, who looks up in SHOCK, but Linguini is already gone, racing back to his station to add 
the new ingredients to a heating pan. Linguini JERKS forward, tilting his toque over the pan, then PEELS OUT of his station, once again on the move.KITCHEN -SAME TIMELinguini ZIPS about snatching ingredients from the other cooks stations, a Porche apologizing for its driver. LINGUINI(ad-lib to cooks)Pardon me, just need to borrow this 
real quick-- sorry-- apparently I 
need this-- IÕll be right back--To the others, Linguini looks deranged; a man whoÕs clearly 
lost control of both his body and his faculties. Linguini careens back into his station and DUMPS the ingredients into his pan, startling Colette--COLETTEWhat are you doing? We are supposed 
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.LINGUINI(stirring, flipping pan)IÕm, uh... this is the recipe-- COLETTEThe recipe doesnÕt call for white 
truffle oil! What else have you-- 54.(MORE)(she looks in his pan)You are improvising?? This is no time to experiment, the customers 
are waiting!LINGUINIYouÕre right--(to REMY, nudging toque)--I should listen to you!Linguini suddenly SLAPS his own face, then LEANS his toque 
over the Sweetbread.COLETTEStop that--!LINGUINIStop what?COLETTEFreaking me out! Whatever 
youÕre doing-- stop it.HORSTWhere is the special order?Both Colette and Linguini are working quickly now, but on 
separate dishes, giving the appearance of a competition.COLETTEComing!(Low to Linguini)I thought we were together on 
this.LINGUINIWe are together.COLETTEThen what are you doing?LINGUINIItÕs--- VERY hard to explain.HORSTThe special??COLETTECome get it! UNDER THE TOQUERemy watches anxiously as Colette sets the plate at the pass to be picked up, a hank of hair in each paw, waiting for an 
opening. Colette glances at the recipe.COLETTEOh-- I forgot to add the liquorice! She rushes back to get it. Remy sees his chance. Linguini 
finds himself grabbing his pan and hurtling toward Colette. 55.COLETTE (cont'd)AT THE PASSColette is about to add the liquorice sauce when Linguini swoops in and BLOCKS HER HAND. Colette is STUNNED. Her eyes 
FLASH at Linguini, who looks petrified, his left hand holds 
his pan of saute, which trembles over the Sweetbread.COLETTEDonÕt... you... dare.LINGUINIIÕm not, IÕm not, IÕm-- Linguini dumps his saute over ColetteÕs dish the moment 
before it is swept away by the waiter Mustafa.LINGUINI (CONTÕD)--sorry.Skinner enters, smiling as he walks up to Horst.SKINNERIs LinguiniÕs dish done yet?HORSTYa. ItÕs as bad as we remember. 
Just went out. SKINNER(serene)Did you taste it?HORSTOf course... before he changed it.SKINNERGood- WHAT? How could he change it?HORSTHe changed it as it was going out the door!Skinner starts toward the door to the dining room, just as 
MUSTAFA busts through it, excited.MUSTAFAThey love it! Other diners are 
already asking about it, about 
Linguini. I have seven more orders!Colette is nonplussed. Skinner FLINCHES, then forces a smile.56.SKINNERThatÕs... wonderful. INSIDE LINGUINIÕS TOQUERemy slaps his paws together, relishing the night ahead.MONTAGECrosscut between the dining room and the kitchen: orders pile up as word of the ÒspecialÓ spreads between diners. Remy 
pilots Linguini, preparing plate after plate of their hit.THE KITCHEN - LATERThe dinner rush is over. The cooks congratulate their new comrade Linguini, toasting him glasses of table wine.Skinner watches from across the kitchen, STARING at the boy with a mixture of confusion, envy and resentment. As Linguini 
pass in front of a light Skinner SEES IT: a strange shadow 
within LinguiniÕs toque-- --the SILHOUETTE OF A RAT. SkinnerÕs EYES going WIDE.BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAUÕSAfter a quick look around to make sure no oneÕs watching, Linguini removes his toque and lets Remy out.LINGUINITake a break little Chef, get some 
air. We really did it tonight.Linguini unfolds a napkin, revealing a miniature picnic; 
fruit, bread, cheeses. Remy-- pooped but exhilarated-- beams 
at Linguini, who raises his glass in a salute to the rat.Linguini smiles and turns back inside.KITCHEN - CONTINUOUSWe follow Linguini as he crosses the kitchen, humming happily to himself. PANNING INTO FRAME is SKINNER; perched high atop 
a tray rack, waiting like a cat ready to pounce. He SNATCHES 
the toque from LinguiniÕs head--57.--and gapes in confusion when he sees nothing on top of the boyÕs head. He looks at Linguini and SMILES.SKINNER(dangling the toque)Got your toque!Skinner hops to the ground, fluffing the toque with his hand 
before handing it back to the mystified Linguini.SKINNERSeriously now, IÕd love to have a 
little talk with you, Linguini... 
in my office.LINGUINIAm I in trouble...?SKINNERTrouble? Nooo... a little wine, a 
friendly chat. Just us cooks.Colette watches Skinner steer Linguini into his office. HORST(to Colette, re: Linguini)The Plongeur wonÕt be coming to you 
for advice anymore, eh Colette? (nods to SkinnerÕs office)HeÕs gotten all he needs. He exits chuckling. Colette slowly turns away, stung. INSIDE SKINNERÕS OFFICESkinner settles in behind the massive desk that was formerly GusteauÕs. Linguini sits uneasily at a chair facing him, 
still holding his little glass of wine.SKINNERToasting your success, eh Linguini? 
Good for you.LINGUINII just took it to be polite, they 
were being so nice to me, I donÕt 
really drink, you know--SKINNEROf course you donÕt. I wouldnÕt 
either if I was drinking that-- 58.Skinner plucks the glass from LinguiniÕs hand, pours it into a wastebasket, and offers up a newly opened bottle of wine.SKINNER (CONTÕD)-but you would have to be an idiot 
of elephantine proportions not to 
appreciate this Ô61 Chateau Latour. 
And you, MÕsieur Linguini, are no 
idiot. (raising his glass)Let us toast your non-idiocy! A 
votre sante!They clink... and DRINK.OUTSIDE KITCHEN - BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAUÕSRemy munches contentedly and stares at the starry sky, loving his bread, his cheese, his life. He breaks the top off a 
grape and-- holding the stem like a wine glass-- slowly sips 
it into a raisin.Something STIRS behind the trash cans. Remy FREEZES, suddenly alert. Some kind of CREATURE is eating in the shadows. Remy 
grabs the cheese knife and timidly goes to investigate.The creature LOOKS UP, its glowing eyes fix on Remy. Remy GULPS, raises the knife. The creature LEAPS into the light--EMILEREMY!REMYEmile--??They rush to each other, hugging and laughing.REMYWhat are you doing here?! I 
thought IÕd never see you 
guys again!EMILEI canÕt believe it! YouÕre 
alive! You made it! We 
figured you didnÕt survive 
the rapids!REMYAnd what are you eating??Emile stares at Remy, chewing. He looks down, pondering the 
unrecognizable wad in his hands for a long beat. He FROWNS.EMILEI donÕt really know. I think it was 
some sort of wrapper once. 59.REMYWhat--? No.Remy grabs the wad and throws it away with a flourish.REMYYouÕre in Paris now, baby. My town. No brother of mine eats rejecta-
menta in my town!Remy turns on his heel and marches back into the kitchen.KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATERRemy climbs to the pull handle on the FOOD SAFE DOOR and hesitates there. LAUGHTER emanates from inside of SkinnerÕs 
office. Remy leaps to the handle and with considerable effort 
pushes it open, UNLOCKING the massive door. GUSTEAU appears.GUSTEAU SPRITERemy... you are stealing? You told 
Linguini he could trust you.REMYAnd he can. ItÕs for my brother...GUSTEAU SPRITEThe boy could lose his job.REMYWhich means I would, too. ItÕs 
under control, okay?Remy shoves past the Gusteau spite and into the safe. The 
sprite VANISHES.INSIDE SKINNERÕS OFFICE - SAME TIMELinguini sits back in his chair, looking a bit tipsy.SKINNERMore wine?LINGUINII shouldnÕt. But okay.He offers his glass to Skinner, who refills it generously.SKINNERSo where did you train, Linguini?60.LINGUINI(chuckles, drinking)Train? Alright...SKINNERSurely you donÕt expect me to believe this is your first time 
cooking?LINGUINIItÕs not.SKINNERI KNEW IT!LINGUINIItÕs my...(stops, counts on fingers)...second, third, four-- fifth 
time. Monday was my first time.(Skinner wilts)But IÕve taken out the garbage lots 
of times before this, thatÕs why I--SKINNER(cutting him off, pouring)Yes yes yes. Have some more wine. 
Tell me about your interests. Do 
you like animals? LINGUINIWhat--? Animals? What kind?SKINNEROh, the usual. Dogs, cats, horses, 
guinea pigs... (pointed)...rats.BACK ENTRANCE - GUSTEAUÕS - MINUTES LATERRemy carries a small bundle of gourmet foodstuffs from the kitchen, only to find Emile again munching on garbage.REMYI brought you something to-- AGH!!   
No no NO! Spit that out right now! (Emile does, shamed)I have GOT to teach you about food! 
Close your eyes.61.As Emile closes his eyes, his SURROUNDINGS FADE TO BLACK. Remy delicately holds a hunk of cheese under EmileÕs nose--REMYNow... take a bite of thi--Emile INHALES it. Horrified, Remy scolds him like a bad pet.REMY (CONTÕD)-NO NO NO! DonÕt just hork it down! EMILEToo late.Annoyed, Remy hands him another piece of cheese. Emile eats 
it,  this time more carefully.REMYChew it slowly... think only about 
the taste. See? A vague, grayish BLOB half-forms above his head. It MOVES to 
undefined MUSIC as Emile struggles to experience the food...EMILENot really.REMYCreamy, salty sweet. An oaky 
nuttiness? You detect that? Emile opens his eyes (surroundings reappear), looks at Remy.EMILEOh, IÕm detecting nuttiness.REMYClose your eyes. Now taste this. (gives him a strawberry)Whole different thing, right? 
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the 
finish?The BLOB reappears, but this time with a hint of color. EMILEOkay.REMYNow try them together. Uh-huh. See? 62.Emile eats both together and chews, concentrating. Slowly the weak COLORS become bolder and more complimentary. They begin 
to dance and intermingle as a little MELODY takes shape...EMILEOkay... I think IÕm getting a 
little something there. It might be 
the nuttiness. Could be the tang.REMYThatÕs it! Now imagine every great 
taste in the world being combined 
into infinite combinations, tastes 
that no one has tried yet!! 
Discoveries to be made!EMILEI think--- you lost me again.Emile opens his eyes. The SHAPES and SOUND FADE AWAY. Sensing 
RemyÕs disappointment, Emile reassures him.EMILEBut that was interesting. Most 
interesting garbage I ever-- HEY! 
What are we doing? Dad doesnÕt know 
youÕre alive. WeÕve gotta go to the 
colony!! Everyone will be thrilled!REMYYeah... but, uh... thing is, I 
kinda have to... uh...Remy gestures vaguely at the kitchen. Emile frowns.EMILEWhat? What do you ÒhaftaÓ more than 
family? WhatÕs more important?He glares furiously at Remy, whose resolve starts to crumble. REMYWell, it wouldnÕt hurt to visit...INSIDE SKINNERÕS OFFICE - STILL LATERA few EMPTY BOTTLES of wine litter SkinnerÕs desk. Linguini is BOMBED, but SkinnerÕs increasingly desperate inquisition 
is getting nowhere.SKINNERHave you ever had a pet rat??LINGUININope.63.SKINNERDid you work in a lab with rats?LINGUININope.SKINNERPerhaps you lived in squalor 
at some point??LINGUININopety nopety new.SKINNERI KNOW you know something about 
RATS! You know you do!!LINGUINIYou know who know do whacka do. 
Ratta tatta- hey! Why do they call 
it that?SKINNERWhat?!LINGUINIRatatouille. ThereÕs a dish called 
that, itÕs like a stew, right? Why 
do they call it that? If youÕre 
gonna name a food you should give 
it a name that sounds delicious. 
Ratatouille doesnÕt sound 
delicious. It sounds like rat. And 
patooty. Rat patooty! Which does 
NOT sound delicious.Linguini drinks, finds his glass empty. He smiles, offering 
his glass for Skinner to refill.SKINNER(scowling)Regrettably-- He drops the empty bottle into the trash with a loud THUNK.SKINNER (CONTÕD)--we are all out of wine.INSIDE SEWER - RAT COMMONS - A LITTLE LATERSeveral channels converge into a wide, open area as dreary and uninviting as any sewer, save for a flotilla of tiny 
BOATS illuminated by a scattering of multi-colored lanterns 
that answer the gloom with magic.Holding their clasped paws up victoriously, Django turns from Remy to face the assembled crowd of rats.64.DJANGOMY SON... HAS RETURNED!An enormous CHEER erupts. Emile joins Django and Remy as the clan crowds around them. RemyÕs joy is clouded with doubt; 
what about his new life?RAT ENCAMPMENT - LATERA PARTY is in full swing. The entire rat clan has come out to bop to boisterous MUSIC played by a jazzy RAT BAND, kicking 
down the jams in a unique gypsy/jitterbug dance style that 
takes full advantage of their tails and all four legs. Joined by his sons, Django sits at a prime table. A WAITER RAT quickly serves a round of drinks in well-worn thimbles 
between them. Emile and Django suck theirs down. Remy takes a 
discreet whiff and sets it aside.DJANGOAnd finding someone to replace you 
for poison checker has been a 
disaster. NothingÕs been poisoned, 
thank God, but it hasnÕt been easy. 
You didnÕt make it easy. REMYI know. I am sorry, Dad.DJANGOWell, the important thing is that 
youÕre home. REMYYeah... well, uh, about that...DJANGOYou look thin. Why is that? A 
shortage of food or a surplus of 
snobbery? Emile joins in as Django cracks up at his own joke. DJANGOItÕs tough out there in the big 
world all alone, isnÕt it? REMYSure... but, itÕs not like IÕm a 
kid anymore. 65.A well-wisher drops by to say hello to Django. Remy takes advantage of the distraction to quickly deliver the bad news.REMYI can take care of myself. IÕve found a nice spot not far away, so 
IÕll be able to visit often.DJANGO(resuming conversation)Nothing like a cold splash of 
reality to make you-- (sudden realization)--ÒvisitÓ? REMYI will, I promise. Often.DJANGOYouÕre not staying? REMYItÕs not a big deal, Dad. (gently)You didnÕt think I was going to 
stay forever, did you? Eventually a 
birdÕs gotta leave the nest.DJANGOWeÕre not birds, weÕre rats. We 
donÕt leave nests, we make them 
bigger.REMYMaybe IÕm different kind of rat.DJANGOMaybe youÕre not a rat at all.REMYMaybe thatÕs a good thing. EMILE(trying to break tension)Hey, the bandÕs really on tonight!REMYRats! All we do is take, Dad. IÕm 
tired of taking. I want to make 
things! I want to add something to 
this world.66.DJANGOYouÕre talking like a human.REMYWho are not as bad as you say.DJANGOOh yeah?EMILEOh man...DJANGOWhat makes you so sure?Remy hesitates for a beat, suddenly careful.REMYIÕve uh, been able to, uh, observe them at a close-ish sort of range.DJANGOYeah? How close?REMYClose enough. And theyÕre, yÕknow, 
not so bad. As you say. They are.Django GLARES at Remy, scrutinizing him. DJANGOCome with me... I got something I 
want you to see. He moves from the table, dropping to all fours and heading 
off. Reluctantly, Remy does likewise, leaving Emile alone.EMILEYou know... I think IÕll stay here. KITCHEN - GUSTEAUÕS RESTAURANT - SAME TIMEThe sound of raindrops patter against the skylight. Skinner, bundled up in a well-tailored overcoat, throws a scarf around 
his neck. Linguini tipsily hands him his beret.SKINNERMake sure the floors and counter-
tops are clean before you lock up.LINGUINIYou want me to... stay and clean?67.SKINNERIs that a problem?Linguini slumps and drunkenly shakes his head ÒnoÓ.SKINNERGood boy. See you tomorrow.Skinner exits, humming. Linguini watches him go with weary eyes. He turns to face the messy kitchen... and wilts.PARIS STREET - NIGHTItÕs raining harder now. Django and Remy arrive at a drain opening, through which can be glimpsed the rough cobblestones 
of a city street. DJANGOWeÕre here.Django scrambles out the curb-side drain and turns to face 
the storefront behind them. Remy sits next to him and looks 
up, following his fatherÕs gaze. His jaw drops in horror.Displayed in the window of the small shop are a variety of nasty looking metal traps, RAT TRAPS to be precise, and along 
side of those hang row after row of DEAD RATS.DJANGOTake a good, long look, Remy. This 
is what happens when a rat gets a 
little too comfortable around 
humans.Remy looks away. DjangoÕs tone is tender, but firm.DJANGOThe world we live in belongs to the 
enemy. We must live carefully. We look out for our own kind, Remy. 
When all is said and done, weÕre 
all weÕve got.His point made, Django turns to go. Remy stares up at the 
horrible window, then softly says--REMYNo.DJANGO(stops in his tracks)What..?68.REMYNo, Dad. I donÕt believe it. YouÕre telling me that the future is-- can 
ONLY be-- (points at window)--more of this?DJANGOThis... is the way things are. You 
canÕt change nature.REMYChange IS nature, Dad. The part 
that we can influence. And it 
starts when we decide.With that, Remy turns and-- walking upright on two legs-- 
starts back to GusteauÕs. Django calls after him.DJANGOWhere you goinÕ?REMYWith luck... forward.OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - GUSTEAUÕS - MORNINGThe storm has passed and the sky is cloudless and clear. As a weary Remy exits the sewer, the fresh air hits his nostrils 
and he draws it in like a sweet memory. He exhales, renewed and happy to be back in his brave new world. Forgetting himself, he trots for the kitchen entrance 
on two legs, throwing a reckless wave at a passing CYCLIST. The cyclist DOUBLE-TAKES, craning his neck to look at the bizarre sight-- and collides with a parked car. KITCHEN - GUSTEAUÕS RESTAURANT Remy enters and looks around. No one has arrived yet. Remy steps on to the counter top and surveys the kitchen, savoring 
the day ahead. And then he hears the sound. SNORING.He TAKES COVER and peers out. No one is there, but the SNORING persists. He peers cautiously over the edge--REMYÕS POV--as Remy walks forward, REVEALING:69.LINGUINI-- curled up on the floor and slumbering like a vagrant. Remy looks at the clock, realizing with horror that 
the others are about to arrive. Remy jumps onto LinguiniÕs head like a rough rider on a fallen horse and-- expertly TUGGING hanks of LinguiniÕs hair, 
manages to get the boy up on his feet. But Linguini remains FAST ASLEEP. Remy lifts one of LinguiniÕs heavy EYELIDS and waves frantically at a staring 
eye-- but Linguini is OUT COLD.The SOUND of a motorcycle arriving at the rear entrance causes Remy to looks around in desperation. He spies a pair 
of SUNGLASSES near the cookÕs lockers. Colette ENTERS, unpleasantly surprised to find LINGUINI already at work. She crosses to their station and starts 
prep. Remy has hidden LinguiniÕs shut eyes behind sunglasses, 
unintentionally giving him the air of a smug ROCK STAR. Though Linguini remains fast ASLEEP, Remy pulls his hair to keep the boyÕs limbs working somewhat convincingly. COLETTE(cool, formal)Good morning. INTERCUT: UNDER LINGUINIÕS TOQUE/ COLETTE & LINGUINIRemy pulls hair, nervously puppeting the sleeping Linguini. How can he make Linguini answer? He PULLS a side hair hank----causing LinguiniÕs head to loll to Colette, give her a lazy nod, then turn back to his work. COLETTESo. The Chef. He invited you in for 
a drink? ThatÕs big... thatÕs big. 
What did he say? UNDER LINGUINIÕS TOQUERemy hesitates. ThereÕs no hair he can pull for speech! Desperate, he pulls the head-turn hair again. RESUME SCENELinguiniÕs head lolls lazily back to Colette, the effect being a smug ÒWhat do you think he said, babe?Ó70.COLETTEWhat-- you canÕt tell me? Linguini is silent. He resumes cutting. Colette goes cold.COLETTEOh. Forgive me for intruding on your deep, personal relationship 
with the Chef. I see how it is. You 
get me to teach you a few kitchen 
tricks to dazzle the boss, and then 
you blow past me?UNDER LINGUINIÕS TOQUEThings are going bad fast. Remy keeps Linguini chopping, hoping desperately for an idea to salvage the situation. REMYCaÕmon. Wake up... wake up--!RESUME SCENELinguini keeps chopping vegetables like a hip zombie. His smirking face rolls in ColetteÕs direction.COLETTE(small, hurt)I thought you were different. I 
thought you thought I was 
different. I thought--Now, seemingly looking straight at her, Linguini SNORES.Colette GASPS and delivers a roundhouse SLAP to LinguiniÕs face. Linguini CORKSCREWS and CRASHES to the floor.Linguini-- now completely awake and utterly confused at the crucial chunk of his life heÕs somehow missed-- looks up at 
the furious Colette with wide eyes. COLETTEI didnÕt have to help you. If I 
looked out only for myself, I could 
have let you drown. But--(this is hard for her)--I wanted you to succeed. I liked you. My mistake.71.Colette turns, storming out the kitchenÕs back door. Both Linguini and Remy- who peers out of LinguiniÕs fallen toque, 
watch he go. Linguini turns to Remy.LINGUINIItÕs over, Little Chef. I canÕt do 
it any more.He grabs the toque with Remy inside and runs after Colette.OUTSIDE GUSTEAUÕS - ALLEY BEHIND KITCHEN - CONTINUOUSColette is already on her motorcycle. Linguini runs to her.LINGUINIStop--! DonÕt motorcycle away--(She atops, looks at him)Look. IÕm no good with words. IÕm no good with food, either. At least 
not without your help.COLETTEI hate false modesty. ItÕs just

surpassed only by LinguiniÕs own.INSIDE LINGUINIÕS TOQUEWith furrowed brows and gritted teeth, Remy maintains LinguiniÕs forward thrust kiss. This could go either way.

toque to see ColetteÕs cycle disappear over the horizon! Car horns BLARE. Remy turns to see a massive WALL OF TRAFFIC barreling toward him. He dives clear as CARS roar past,

You did not know! How could I??REMYWell, YOUR SON is the rightful 
owner of this restaurant!SKINNER OPENS the office door and FREEZES-- stunned by the 
bizarre sight of a RAT on his desk top. Remy SNATCHES the 
DOCUMANTS in his mouth and RUNS. OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - MORNING - CONTINUOUSRemy races out into the street. Hot on his heels, Skinner runs smack into LALO on a moped. Before the mortified Lalo 
can apologize Skinner is back on his feet.SKINNERNo... NO--! The rat! ItÕs stolen my 
documents! ItÕs getting away!!With an crazed shriek, Skinner pushes Lalo off the scooter, 
jumps on and roars off down the street.PARIS STREETS - CONTINUOUSSkinner screeches to a stop at the INTERSECTION, looks around wildly for Remy. He sights the DOCUMENTS scampering through 
traffic and guns the motor, recklessly giving chase. 84.NEAR THE SEINE - MOVING WITH SKINNERClosing in on Remy, Skinner reaches down to snatch the documents when the rat suddenly VEERS. SkinnerÕs Moped 
plunges down a flight of steps to the river, where it lays in 
a heap at the bottom. Skinner looks up, sees--REMY-- looking down at him from the balustrade, documents still clutched in his mouth. Remy LAUGHS. A gust from a 
passing BUS sweeps the WILL from RemyÕs open jaws and high 
into the air, where it flutters out over the riverÕs edge.MOVING ALONG THE BANKS - CONTINUOUSSKINNER sees his chance. He clambers aboard the Moped and takes off after the will, dodging obstacles and passers-by to 
pursue from the banks below. Remy chases it from the 
balustrade above, the letter still in his mouth. THE WILL begins to descend, flitting toward Skinner below, who reaches for it, his fingers spreading wide--Remy makes two desperate LEAPS; from the balustrade to a tree, from the tree into the air just above Skinner where he--INTERCEPTS the will-- sailing toward the water and landing with a FWOP on the canvas roof of a Bateux Mouche. Remy canÕt 
believe heÕs got both documents again. Neither can Skinner. He ditches the Moped and LEAPS to the deck of the Seine boat. ON THE SEINE - MOVING BETWEEN THE BOATSRemy, documents in mouth, leaps to another passing boat, Skinner still hot on his tail.A jam of water traffic keeps this game alive, the two leaping from boat to boat, but the last leap, to a DINING BOAT- is 
too far. Remy tries anyway; launching into the air, the 
documents in his mouth sweep back like WINGS and he----catches an updraft! He SAILS across the gulf, landing miraculously on the deck. Skinner crazily follows, making the leap of his life as he stretches out for the dining boatsÕ railing and-- 85.--falls short, grasping instead the tablecloth of a couple dining near the railing, which he yanks out from under their 
breakfast like an inept magician as he----plunges into the river. Skinner sputters in the middle of the Seine as Remy hops up to a bridge passing overhead, 
scampering safely away with SkinnerÕs papers.GUSTEAUÕS - SKINNERÕS OFFICE - AN HOUR LATERSkinner returns to his office, soaked and furious... only to find LINGUINI sitting at his desk.SKINNERYou?? Get out of my office.COLETTEHeÕs not in your office. You are in

looks at Linguini, who can only shrug with embarrassment.THE FRONT PAGE OF A NEWSPAPER--spins into a close up.

says in a low, tight voice-LINGUININot that, dearest... I meant you.Just then the front door swings open, spilling cold light and 
air into the warmth of the restaurant. The press swings its 
attention to the tall, backlit spectre at the entrance, 
whispering his legendary name: ÒEgoÓ. He glides through them 
without acknowledging their presence, and stops in front of 
Linguini, who is still seated.EGOYou are Monsieur Linguini? LINGUINIUh, hello.EGOPardon me for interrupting your...

of COFFEE BEANS, leaving only their tiny NOSES visible. 94.EMILE hides in the center of an ASPARAGUS BUNCH held together by a rubber band. His eyes latch on to a juicy BUNCH OF 
GRAPES, which hang literally in front of his face. Enticed, he leans forward just enough to get his lips around the end of a single grape, and s-l-o-w-l-y SUCKS IT OFF THE 
STEM into his mouth, swallowing it whole. Mmmnn. He glances up: another grape beckons. Emile leans for it--LINGUINI (CONTÕD)...IÕve never disappointed anyone before because nobodyÕs ever

lashes the asparagus rubber band to the shelf and leans out 
over the edge, straining to reach the lone grape...LINGUINI (CONTÕD)The most honorable friend a guy 
could ever ask--The cheese wheel SHIFTS. Emile loses his balance and falls, 
hits the floor spread-eagled. The CHEESE lands on top of him,

spilling from the shelves in a squeaking, fur covered WAVE

He waits on a lone DINER, whose face is hidden behind a menu.LINGUINIDo you know what youÕd like, sir?The MENU lowers, revealing EGO. He GRINS, ravenous.EGOYes; IÕd like your heart, roasted 
on a spit--!96.LINGUINI (cont'd)Linguini is frozen in fear, his heart pounding as EgoÕs cold chuckle turns into a ROAR--INSIDE HEAD CHEFÕS OFFICE - MORNING - CONTINUOUSLinguini AWAKENS. Someone is POUNDING is at his office door.LINGUINIC--come... COME IN!!The door opens and Colette leans in, speaking tenderly--COLETTEToday is a big day. You should say something to them.LINGUINILike what...?COLETTEYou are the boss. Inspire them.KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER  Linguini places a step ladder at the front of the kitchen and stands on the top step. He clears his throat.LINGUINIAttention. Attention everyone. The staff pauses and turns their attentions to Linguini.LINGUINITonight is a big night. Appetite is 
coming and heÕs going to have a big 
Ego. (stops, corrects himself)I mean Ego. HeÕs coming. The 
critic? And heÕs going to order. 
Something. Something from our menu. 
And weÕll have to cook it. Unless 
he orders something cold. Like a 
salad. The COOKS exchange confused glances. Colette wilts. This is 
not the inspiration she had in mind.OUTSIDE REAR KITCHEN ENTRANCE - GUSTEAUÕS - SAME MOMENTRemy is watching this through the kitchen window. He sighs.97.EMILEJust canÕt leave it alone, can yaÕ?Emile is by the trash. Remy HOPS DOWN and walks over to him. REMYYou really shouldnÕt be here during restaurant hours, itÕs not safe. EMILEIÕm hungry. And I donÕt need the 
inside food to be happy. The key, 
my friend, is to not be picky. 
Observe...Emile lifts the corner of a toppled-over BOX, exposing a 
chunk of CHEESE. Emile chuckles, reaching for the cheese-- REMYNo-- WAIT--Remy grabs EmileÕs tail and pulls him clear. A HINGE DROPS, 
trapping Remy inside a CAGE. Emile rushes to Remy, panicked.EMILEOh no! WhatÕll we do?! IÕll go get 
Dad!A SHADOW looms over them. Emile quickly hides. SKINNER picks 
up the trap/cage, grinning ear to ear.SKINNERYou may think you are a chef, but 
you are still... only a rat. KITCHEN - SAME TIMEThe cooks are sitting now, bored out of their minds. Linguini is still talking.LINGUINI (CONTÕD)-sure he took away a star last time 
he reviewed this place. Sure, it 
probably killed Gust-- Dad. LALO(softly to himself)Oh, this is very bad juju here-o.LINGUINI (CONTÕD)But IÕll tell you one thing--98.Mustafa bursts through the dining room door, interrupting--MUSTAFAEgo is here.The air is suddenly sucked from the room. The cooks stand alert, frightened. Sensing what is needed, Colette steps up. COLETTEArnot Ego is just another customer. 
LetÕs cook!An intent look sweeps the faces of the staff. With a burst of 
grunts, cries and hand claps they return to work.LINGUINI(a beat too late)Yeah--! LetÕs-- okay...STREET NEAR GUSTEAUÕS - MOMENTS LATERRemyÕs cage is set down inside the trunk of SKINNERÕS CAR. Remy looks up at Skinner.SKINNERSo! I have in mind a simple arrange-
ment; you will create for me a new 
line of Chef Skinner frozen foods, 
and I, in return, will not kill 
you. Remy STARTLES, looks aghast. Laughing, Skinner SLAMS SHUT the 
trunk and EXITS toward the restaurant. Nearby, EMILE watches 
cautiously.SKINNERAu revoir, rat! GUSTEAUÕS RESTAURANT - DINING AREA - NIGHT  Mustafa draws a deep breath, gathering courage. He turns and approaches EgoÕs table. MUSTAFADo you know what youÕd like this 
evening, sir?Ego lifts his gaze to Mustafa. 99.EGOYes, I think I do. After reading a lot of overheated puffery about 
your new cook, you know what IÕm 
craving? A little perspective. Ego SNAPS his menu shut and hands it to Mustafa.EGOThatÕs it. IÕd like some fresh, 
clear, well-seasoned perspective. 
Can you suggest a good wine to go 
with that?MUSTAFA (baffled)With what, sir?EGOPerspective. Fresh out, I take it?MUSTAFAUh... IÕm sorry?MUSTAFAVery well. Since youÕre all out of 
perspective and no one else seems 
to have it in this bloody town, 
IÕll make you a deal; you provide 
the food, IÕll provide the 
perspective. Which would go nicely 
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.MUSTAFAUhm... IÕm afraid I-- I didnÕt... 
your dinner selection...?Ego jumps to his feet, suddenly eye to eye with Mustafa.EGOTell your ÒChef LinguiniÓ that I 
want whatever he dares to serve to 
me. Tell him to Òhit me with his 
best shotÓ.Mustafa scurries off. Seated at a nearby table (and disguised 
in a trenchcoat, sunglasses and beret), SKINNER jerks his 
head toward Ego and speaks to his waiter-- SKINNER(deep voice)I will have whatever he is having. 100.INSIDE SKINNERÕS CAR TRUNKRemy sits in the corner of his cage, alone and defeated. The GUSTEAU SPRITE appears. He studies Remy, speaking quietly.GUSTEAUSo... weÕve given up.REMYWhy do you say that?GUSTEAU(looks around, shrugs)We are in a cage. Inside a car 
trunk. Awaiting a future in frozen 
food products.REMYNo, IÕm the one in a cage. IÕve given up. You... are free.GUSTEAUI am only as free as you imagine me 
to be. As you are.REMYOh please. IÕm sick of pretending. 
I pretend to be a rat for my 
father. I pretend to be a human 
through Linguini. I pretend you 
exist so I have someone to talk to! 
You only tell me stuff I already 
know! I know who I am! Why do I 
need you to tell me? Why do I need 
to pretend?Gusteau smiles with affection and relief.GUSTEAUAh, but you donÕt, Remy...He floats to Remy, puts his hands squarely on the ratÕs 
shouldersGUSTEAU (CONTÕD)...you never did.And with that, Gusteau... FADES AWAY. A loud THUNK as 
something hits the street pavement outside.101.CATHEDRAL ACROSS FROM GUSTEAUÕS - DUSKA STONE GARGOYLE has just missed the trunk of SkinnerÕs car and SHATTERED on the pavement. DJANGO, clearly annoyed, calls 
to GIT the musclebound lab rat, whoÕs perched on the one 
gargoyle-less balustrade above.DJANGONo. My OTHER left!Git grunts, moves to the next gargoyle and PUSHES--INSIDE SKINNERÕS CAR TRUNKRemy, alert and excited now, calls out.REMYDad?!!WHAM! --the top of the trunk suddenly CAVES IN from the second GARGOYLEÕs impact. Light streams in as EMILE appears.REMYEmile! Django joins Emile as he grabs the cage latch from the 
outside. Straining with all their might, the three rats pop 
it open. Remy jumps out, gives Django and Emile quick hugs--REMYI love you guys.-then scrambles out the trunk and takes off toward GUSTEAUÕS.DJANGOWhere you going??REMY(calling back)Back to the restaurant! TheyÕll 
fail without me!DJANGOWHY DO YOU CARE??REMYBECAUSE IÕM A COOK!!102.INSIDE KITCHEN - GUSTEAUÕS - SAME TIMECHAOS. Tempers are flaring, orders are piling up and the kitchen is dissolving under LinguiniÕs leadership. Holding a 
pan filled with grey glop, Horst confronts Linguini.HORSTItÕs your recipe! How can you not 
know your own recipe??LINGUINII didnÕt write it down, it just-- 
came to me!HORSTWell make it come to you again, 
because we canÕt serve this!!MUSTAFAWhereÕs my order??LINGUINICanÕt we serve them something 
else?? Something I didnÕt 
invent??LA ROUSSEThis is what theyÕre 
ordering!!LINGUINIMake them order something 
else!! Tell them weÕre all 
out!POMPIDOUWe canÕt be all out, we just 
opened-LA ROUSSEI have another idea; what if 
we served them what they 
order??COLETTEWe will make it. Just tell us 
what you did!LINGUINII donÕt know what I did!HORSTWe need to tell the customers 
something!LINGUINI(hysteria building)Then tell them-- tell them-- 
AUGH!!Linguini runs into his office and slams the door closed.LA ROUSSE(to Lalo, beat)ÒAughÓ...?103.OUTSIDE BACK KITCHEN ENTRANCE - GUSTEAUÕS - SAME TIMEDjango and Emile rush to stop Remy as he heads toward the kitchen door--DJANGORemy!EMILETheyÕll see you! STOP!--but Remy pushes them away long enough to get inside the 
doorway, exposing himself to two COOKS. The other rats HIDE.COLETTEHeÕs come far too fast! Could you 
do more with as little experience??HORSTWe are not talking about me! WeÕre 
talking about what to do right n--!Horst suddenly FREEZES-- his gaze fixed on the back entrance. 
There, smack dab in the middle of the doorway, sits REMY, as 
brash as a tiny gunslinger entering a saloon.COLETTERAAAAT!!Instantly the other COOKS seize dangerous utencils and CHARGE 
at Remy. But REMY DOESNÕT MOVE. Suddenly, a voice SHOUTS-- LINGUINIDONÕT TOUCH HIM!!Miraculously, everyone STOPS, their weapons raised, their 
gaze shifting to LINGUINI, who rushes in front of the group.LINGUINII know this sounds insane. But- 
well, the truth sounds insane 
sometimes, but that doesnÕt mean 
itÕs not. The truth.The COOKS exchange confused glances.LINGUINIAnd the truth is I have no talent 
at all. But this Rat... heÕs the 
one behind these recipes. HeÕs the 
cook. The real cook. Little Chef?  The COOKS watch in amazement as Remy hops onto his lowered 
palm. Linguini lifts Remy up to his head to demonstrate.104.LINGUINI (CONTÕD)HeÕs been hiding under my toque. He chooses the ingredients, the spices- Linguini picks up some spices lifting them to RemyÕs nose. 
The other cooks react; this strange and familiar action of 
LinguiniÕs is suddenly stranger than ever. LINGUINI (CONTÕD)--heÕs been controlling my actions.Remy gives LinguiniÕs hair a few tugs to demonstrate, 
LinguiniÕs limbs move correspondingly. LINGUINI (CONTÕD)HeÕs the reason I can cook the food 
thatÕs exciting everyone, the 
reason Ego is outside that door. 
YouÕve been giving me credit for 
his gift. I know itÕs a hard thing 
to believe, but hey-- you believed 
I could cook, right? Linguini laughs. The cooks stare. He looks at them, earnest.LINGUINILook. This works. ItÕs crazy, but 
it works. We can be the greatest 
restaurant in Paris. And this rat, 
this brilliant little Chef can lead 
us there. Whaddya say? You with me?For a moment no one moves. Then HORST, tears welling up in 
his eyes, crosses to a grateful, moved Linguini and----hands him his apron and toque... EXITING silently out the back door. Linguini watches-- stunned-- as, one by one, the 
rest of the STAFF exits with him, leaving only COLETTE.Colette locks eyes with Linguini, both anger and tears welling up. Her hand comes up to slap him-- --but doesnÕt. Her hand just trembles, and finally drops to her side. She pushes past Linguini and out the door.Linguini looks out at Dining room: Ego WAITS, drumming his fingers. Soon the customers will get restless. Linguini 
exchanges a sad look with Remy, shrinks into his office, 
closes the door behind him. 105.PARIS STREETS - MOVING WITH COLETTE - NIGHTCOLETTE speeds her motorcycle recklessly through the streets, crying. A car horn BLASTS. She STARTLES, hits the brakes and 
skids TO A STOP, nearly running the red light. She exhales, her heart racing at the close call. She looks up. A familiar COOKBOOK beckons from the display window of a 
used book store: GusteauÕs ÒANYONE CAN COOKÓ.Colette stares at it, feeling a pang of emotion.
CLOSE ON THE COOKBOOK.
CLOSE ON COLETTE. Behind her the traffic light TURNS green.
WIDE SHOT: The traffic on either side of her begins to go. Colette sits atop her motorcycle-- motionless.RESUME GUSTEAUÕS KITCHENAlone in the empty kitchen, Remy faces the dining room door, feeling Ego on the other side, waiting. Remy slowly turns 
away... then realizes that DJANGO is also there.REMYDad--!(he goes to Django)Dad, I-- I donÕt know what to say.DJANGOI was wrong about your friend. And 
about you.REMY Dad, I donÕt want you to think IÕm 
choosing this over family. I canÕt 
choose between two halves of myself-DJANGOIÕm not talking about cooking. IÕm 
talking about guts. This really 
means that much to you?Almost apologetically, Remy NODS. Django sighs, then lets out 
a loud whistle. The RAT CLAN emerges from the shadows, 
quickly surrounding them.106.DJANGOWeÕre not cooks, but we are family. You tell us what to do and weÕll 
get it done.A DOOR CREAK turns the rats attention to the back door where-- --THE HEALTH INSPECTOR has just entered. His eyes bug at the surreal sight: the KITCHEN IS FILLED WITH RATS. Slowly, he 
backs toward the EXIT... and BOLTS!REMYSTOP THAT HEALTH INSPECTOR!Immediately  DJANGO leads half the RAT CLAN after the 
inspector, yelling as he exits out the door.DJANGODELTA TEAM FOLLOW ME! THE REST OF 
YOU STAY AND HELP REMY!ALLEY BEHIND GUSTEAUÕS - INSIDE INSPECTORÕS CAR The inspector JAMS his keys into the ignition and turns. The ENGINE wonÕt turn over. He glances at the rear view mirror 
and sees: a ground-level STAMPEDE OF RATS moving out from the 
kitchen TOWARD HIM.The RATS engulf the car, covering it like a blanket. The ENGINE comes to life. Tires SQUEAL, smoking as the car roars 
from the alley in reverse and pulls a 180 into the street, 
the rats covering it like a grey moss-- KITCHEN - SAME TIMEThe dishwasher opens with a WHOOSH of steam: DOZENS OF RATS EMERGE, their fur clean and fluffy. They disperse with Swat 
Team precision as Remy barks orders.REMYTEAM THREE WILL BE HANDLING FISH, 
TEAM FOUR: ROASTED ITEMS, TEAM 
FIVE: GRILL, TEAM SIX: SAUCES! GET 
TO YOUR STATIONS! LETÕS GO GO GO!LINGUINI  Emerges from his office and is astonished by the sight. Remy and the rats see this is suddenly PAUSE. Linguini walks up to 
Remy, suddenly filled with purpose.107.LINGUINIWe need someone to wait tables.Remy NODS. CUT TO:CHEFS OFFICELinguini turns his backpack upside down. A pair of ROLLER BLADES hit his desk with a CLUNK.DINING AREALinguini, wearing the blades and a WAITERS OUTFIT, explodes through the double doors and sweeps into the dining room, 
distributing MENUS to the diners with economical precision, 
followed miraculously by DRINKS, BREAD, WATER. He arrives at SkinnerÕs table to refill his water. LINGUININo, IÕm sorry for any delay, but weÕre a little short tonight. Skinner glances at EGO, who is scowling as he scribbles in a 
note pad. A big smile stretches across SkinnerÕs face.SKINNERPlease. Take all the time you need.KITCHENThe kitchen is going like blazes; RATS are sauteing, spicing, grilling, cooking up a storm. Remy, nearly overwhelmed with 
the scale of production, is miraculously handling it. Stationed at the pass, EMILE wipes the sauce of the edges of the plates with a cloth, the last crucial bit of quality 
control. Tempted by the sauce, he tries to sneak a lick.REMY (O.S.)EMILE!EMILE(stopping himself)Sorry!DINING AREA - SAME TIMEEgo looks impatiently at his watch, scribbles in his notepad. Then his eyes fall to the soup. He pulls the bowl to him, 
dips a spoon in, TASTING IT. Not bad...108.KITCHENThe RATS are functioning like a well-oiled machine; the perfectly prepared meals hit the pass as quickly as Linguini 
can grab them. The back door pushes open to REVEAL:COLETTE-- staggered by the bizarre spectacle. Looking like she may vomit, she wheels back to the exit, when Linguini 
rushes in, throwing his arms around her.LINGUINI Colette! You came back. Colette, I--COLETTEDONÕT say a word. If I think about 
it I might change my mind. Just 
tell me what the rat wants to cook. MOMENTS LATERRemy flips through GusteauÕs recipe box, finds a certain card and pulls it, showing it to Colette. She frowns.COLETTERatatouille? ItÕs a peasant dish. 
Are you sure you want to serve this 
to Ego? Remy NODS. Colette shrugs and starts to prepare the dish.A TIRE SCREECH is followed by a LOUD CRASH outside. COLETTE looks up as the back door bangs open: the HEALTH INSPECTOR, 
bound and gagged, floats across the floor on a cushion of 
RATS, who quickly dump him in the food safe.Colette shrugs, going with the strange night, and goes to add the first spice to the ratatouille, but is blocked by a 
WOODEN SPOON. She looks up: sees itÕs held by Remy. COLETTEWhat. IÕm making the ratatouille...He looks at the her ingredients and makes a face. COLETTEWell, how would you prepare it?Remy PAUSES, considering this.109.KITCHEN / DINING AREAINTERCUT: (1) Remy REIMAGINING the ratatouille; re-inventing it step by step and demonstrating what he wants to Colette, 
who expertly follows through-- WITH (2) LINGUINI skating 
around the dining room, a ONE-MAN WAIT STAFF.MUSIC CRESCENDOS as LINGUINI delivers the meal to EGOÕS TABLE. Linguini then serves the identical meal to Skinner, 
whoÕs appalled and amused to find that Ego has been served-- SKINNERRatatouille? They must be joking...He looks over at Ego, who seems equally unimpressed. ON EGOHe pokes a fork into the vegetables, examines them for a moment, then brings the food to his lips-- Linguini watches, withering.
As EgoÕs lips close around the ratatouille, the sound, the restaurant around him is WHISKED AWAY--FLASHBACK: FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - A LIFETIME AGOWe are inside a cozy cottage on a golden summer day. The front door is open, a newly crashed BICYCLE lays on the 
ground outside. Next to it stands a five year old ANTON EGO 
with a skinned knee, valiantly holding back tears.His young mother turns from her cooking, and gives him a sympathetic smile. Like all mothers, she knows what to do.MOMENTS LATERYoung EGO, already feeling better, is at a table. His mother touches his cheek and sets a freshly made bowl of ratatouille 
before him, warm and inviting. The boy takes a spoonful into 
his mouth----AND THE PRESENT RUSHES BACK--
Ego is frozen. Astounded. His PEN slips from his hand. It CLATTERS to the floor, breaking the spell. 110.Ego blinks. His eyes fall to his empty fork, which he holds suspended near his mouth. Slowly a long-lost feeling blooms 
inside him. He smiles. And has another forkful.Skinner has seen this. He looks at his ratatouille and tastes it. HeÕs stunned; loving and hating it all at once--SKINNER(as he eats)No... no, it canÕt be...KITCHEN Skinner BURSTS through the double doors.SKINNERWho cooked the ratatouille?! I demand to know!A kitchen full of RATS all stop and LOOK UP AT HIM. CUT TO--INSIDE FOOD SAFESkinner, bound and gagged, is tossed roughly into the corner, where he lands next to the equally bound and gagged HEALTH 
INSPECTOR. They yell muffled protests as the door slams shut.DINING AREAA long FINGER dabs the last smear of remaining sauce from the plate of ratatouille. We follow it to EgoÕs smiling lips. He 
kisses the sauce off his finger tip and turns to Linguini.EGOI canÕt remember the last time I 
asked a waiter to give my 
compliments to the Chef. And now I 
find myself in the extraordinary 
position of having my waiter be the Chef... LINGUINIIÕm just your waiter tonight. EGOThen who do I thank for the meal?Linguini stares for a moment, wondering how to respond. 111.LINGUINIExcuse me a minute.Linguini skates to the kitchen doors, where Colette has been watching from a distance. Ego squints; Linguini and Colette 
are visible through the window panels in a heated discussion. 
Linguini returns to EgoÕs table, this time with Colette.EGOAh, you must be the Ch--COLETTE(interrupts)If you wish to meet the Chef you 
will have to wait until all the 
other customers have gone.Taken aback by the unprecedented demand, Ego acquiesces.EGOSo be it.Colette and Linguini exchange a look. DISSOLVE TO:LATER. The restaurant has cleared, save for Ego, who waits with grim patience. Linguini and Colette emerge from the 
kitchen and silently cross to EgoÕs table, Linguini holding a 
toque upright on the flat of and outstretched hand.Ego stares, his curiosity piqued by this strange sight. Linguini takes a breath and lifts up the toque, revealing 
REMY sitting up on the palm of his hand.REMY (V.O.)At first, Ego thinks itÕs a joke, 
but as Linguini explains, EgoÕs 
smile disappears... A SERIES OF SHOTS: Inside the rat-filled kitchen, Linguini 
and Remy demonstrate their unique working style to Ego, first 
together, then with Remy alone. Colette withers as Ego STARES 
at this in grim deadpan.REMY (V.O.)He doesnÕt react beyond asking an 
occasional question. DINING AREALinguini and Colette are now seated at a table opposite Ego. Remy sits on the table facing Ego, who occasionally glances 
down at him. Finally Ego gets up, and bows slightly.112.REMY (V.O.)And when the story is done, Ego stands, thanks us for the meal--EGOThank you for the meal.REMY (V.O., CONTÕ)--and leaves without another word. EGOÕS OFFICE - NIGHT  In a SERIES OF SHOTS Ego is seen pacing, brooding, staring out one of the enormous picture windows flanking his portrait 
into the night, visibly unsettled... REMY (V.O.)The following day his review 
appears...EGO (V.O.)In many ways the work of a critic 
is easy. We risk very little, yet 
enjoy a position over those who 
offer up their work and their 
selves to our judgement. We thrive 
on negative criticism, which is fun 
to write and to read. -until finally, he sits down at his desk and begins to write.EGO (V.O.)But, the bitter truth we critics 
must face is that, in the grand 
scheme of things... the average 
piece of junk is probably more 
meaningful than our criticism 
designating it so. But there are 
times when a critic truly risks 
something... and that is in the 
discovery and defense of the new. MONTAGE: AFTER CLOSING - NIGHT (TO DAWN)Linguini and Colette emerge from GusteauÕs kitchen into the brisk night air, Remy with them, walking upright. No one 
knows what to think. Colette and Linguini HUG anyway.113.EGO (V.O.)The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new 
needs friends. In the alley behind the kitchen, the strange human/rat 
alliance amicably part ways and head to their respective 
homes above and below the streets of Paris. Only Remy stays 
behind, electing to take in the night and think. EGO (V.O.)Last night I experienced something 
new, an extraordinary meal from an 
singularly unexpected source.
To say that both the meal and its 
maker have challenged my 
preconceptions about fine cooking, 
is a gross understatement-- they 
have rocked me to my core. EGOÕS V.O. CONTINUES as we DISSOLVE between LINGUINI, 
COLETTE, EMILE and DJANGO, and see that no one, rat or human-
is able to sleep this night. EGO (V.O., CONTÕD)In the past I have made no secret 
of my disdain for Chef GusteauÕs 
famous motto: ÒAnyone Can CookÓ. 
But I realize only now do I truly 
understand what he meant. Not 
everyone can become a great artist, 
but a great artist can come from 
anywhere. MONTAGE CONCLUDES with REMY staring at the Eiffel Tower as 
the sky creeps into dawn.EGO (V.O.,CONTÕD)It is difficult to imagine more 
humble origins than those of the 
genius now cooking at GusteauÕs, 
who is, in this criticÕs opinion, 
nothing less than the finest Chef 
in France. KITCHEN - GUSTEAUÕS - MORNINGV.O. CONTINUES as a Colette & Linguini read EGOÕS REVIEW-- EGO (V.O.,CONTÕD)I will be returning to GusteauÕs soon, hungry for more. 114.Colette and Linguini HUG. Gathered with them in GusteauÕs kitchen, Remy & the rat clan CHEER. REMY (V.O.)It was a great night. The happiest 
of my life. But the only thing 
predictable about life is its--SHOT: A bored worker for the MINISTRY OF HEALTH pastes 
ÒCLOSEDÓ notices over the front door of GUSTEAUÕS.REMY (V.O., CONT)--unpredictability. We had to let 
Skinner and the health inspector 
loose, and of course they squealed. 
The food didnÕt matter. Once it got 
out there were rats in the kitchen, 
the restaurant was closed and Ego 
lost his job and his credibility. 
But donÕt feel too bad for him...A BISTRO - DAY - THE PRESENTIn a tiny, warmly lit room, a GROUP OF RATS (including DJANGO & EMILE) are seated around a basket, which has been 
overturned and covered with a napkin to function as a table, 
listening as REMY finishes his story.REMY (CONTÕD)...heÕs doing very well as a small 
business investor. He seems very 
happy. Seated next to Remy, a teenage rat frowns, skeptical.TEEN RAT                                                 How do you know?Remy smiles and points through the small window into the main 
dining room. There ANTON EGO, whose face now has color and a 
few new pounds, dines happily at a prime table. A small BELL rings. Remy glances down into the kitchen. Colette is looking up at him, tapping her wristwatch. REMY(to other rats)Gotta go. Dinner rush.He takes off, jumping into a counter-weighted BASKET made 
especially for him. HeÕs quickly dropped into the kitchen.115.
