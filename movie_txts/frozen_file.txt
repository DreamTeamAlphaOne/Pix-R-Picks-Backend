This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn? Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back and hits Anna in the face.ANNA(grossed out)Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.  She wipes off her face. KRISTOFFSo tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?ANNA...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because IÕd only just met him,

from the sled. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
Jump, Sven!Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back. Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled. Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge. KristoffÕs sled loses momentum. ItÕs not going to make it. He leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air. He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below and burst into flames. FROZEN - J. Lee         49KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)

Whoa.... IÕll replace your sled and everything in it. Kristoff groans.ANNA (CONTÕD)
And I understand if you donÕt want 
to help me anymore.  Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.  KRISTOFF Of course I donÕt want to help her 
anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again. KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONTÕD)
But sheÕll die on her own.

Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in branches, just as baffled as they are. In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind them. OLAF (CONTÕD)

smiles happily, then looks confused. OLAFWait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?ANNA(sympathetic)...Okay. Wait one second. Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.FROZEN - J. Lee         53OLAF Oooh! Thank you!ANNAYouÕre welcome.
OLAFNow IÕm perfect.
She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea. ANNAWell, almost.She digs into KristoffÕs satchel, holds up a carrot just as 
Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the way through his head. OLAFWoo! Head rush!ANNAOh! Too hard. IÕm sorry! I-I, I was just.... Are you okay?Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his eyes. He lights up. OLAFAre you kidding me? I am wonderful! IÕve always wanted a nose.
(going cross-eyed to look at his tiny nose)So cute. ItÕs like a little baby 
unicorn.Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.OLAF (CONTÕD)
What? Hey! Whoa. (seeing his now big nose)Oh, I love it even more! Hah.... All right, letÕs start this thing 
over. Hi everyone. IÕm Olaf. And I 
like warm hugs.Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.  ANNAOlaf?...ThatÕs right, Olaf.
FROZEN - J. Lee         54OLAF...And you are?  ANNAOh, um...IÕm Anna.
OLAFAnd whoÕs the funky-looking donkey

OLAFUh-huh. And whoÕs the reindeer?
ANNA...Sven.Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused. OLAFOh. TheyÕre--oh, okay....

OLAF (CONTÕD)
Ha. Aw, look at him tryinÕ to kiss 
my nose. (gushes)I like you, too! ANNAOlaf, did Elsa build you?OLAFYeah. Why? Curious, Kristoff takes one of OlafÕs twig arms off, studies it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm. ANNADo you know where she is?KRISTOFF(studying the arm)Fascinating... OLAFYeah. Why? FROZEN - J. Lee         55ANNADo you think you could show us the way? OLAFYeah. Why?KRISTOFF(bending the arm)How does this work?OlafÕs dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.
OLAFStop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.(to Anna)Yeah, why?KRISTOFFIÕll tell you why. We need Elsa to 
bring back summer.OLAF(shocked)Summer?(sinking into wistfulness)Oh, I donÕt know why but IÕve 
always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.KRISTOFFReally? IÕm guessing you donÕt have 
much experience with heat. OLAFNope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what itÕd be

tradable goods? HANS(tall and confident)Princess Anna has given her orders and-- FROZEN - J. Lee         59DUKEAnd thatÕs another thing; has it

HANSDo not question the Princess. She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason.DUKE(flabbergasted, offended)Treason?! Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of AnnaÕs horse. It 
returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins. HANSWhoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy. CROWD(various)Princess AnnaÕs horse. What

ANNA(confident)Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.KRISTOFFThatÕs your plan? My ice business 
is riding on you talking to your sister. ANNAYup. Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesnÕt look where 
heÕs going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He 
stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.  KRISTOFFSo youÕre not at all afraid of her?  
ANNAWhy would I be? OLAF(oblivious)Yeah. I bet ElsaÕs the nicest,

one rope, and you donÕt know how to climb mountains.ANNA (O.S.)Says who? Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to climb the cliffÕs flat face. 
KRISTOFF(finding her ridiculous)What are you doing? ANNA(straining)...IÕm going to see my sister. 
KRISTOFFYouÕre going to kill yourself. 
Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)

Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.ANNAHa ha. Thank goodness. Catch!Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.

Why isnÕt she knocking...? Do you

apologize.... But you should probably go, please. ANNABut I just got here.   ELSA...You belong in Arendelle. ANNASo do you. Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more. ELSANo, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody. ANNA...Actually, about that--OLAF (O.S.)58...59...60.ELSAWait. What is that? Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves. OLAF  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs. ELSA(shocked)Olaf?Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated. FROZEN - J. Lee         66OLAF(bashful)You built me. You remember that? ELSA(astonished)And you're alive? OLAFUm...I think so?Anna kneels down beside Olaf.ANNAHeÕs just like the one we built as 
kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again. Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her. FLASH CUT TO:FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by ElsaÕs powers.

ANNAWE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room. ELSANO! ANNA (O.S.)WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...AnnaÕs voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.
ELSAI CANÕT!
ElsaÕs fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees. Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff rush into the room to AnnaÕs side. 
KRISTOFFAnna. Are you okay?FROZEN - J. Lee         70ANNAIÕm okay.... IÕm fine.
Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain. ELSA(scared)WhoÕs this? Wait, it doesnÕt 
matter. You have to go. ANNANo, I know we can figure this out together--ELSA(desperate)How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me? Anna doesnÕt have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna. KRISTOFFAnna, I think we should go.ANNA(close to tears)No. IÕm not leaving without you, 
Elsa. ELSA(heartbroken but decisive)Yes, you are.Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman. WeÕll call him MARSHMALLOW. 
SLAM CUT TO:EXT. ICE PALACE Ñ DAYMarshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.  ANNAStop. Put us down! OLAF (to Marshmallow)You are a lot stronger than I think you realize.Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps. FROZEN - J. Lee         71MARSHMALLOW(like a bouncer)Go away! Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, whoÕs got his tongue stuck to the ice railing. OLAF (O.S.)Heads up! OlafÕs head smashes into a snowbank nearby.
ANNAOlaf!OLAFWatch out for my butt!Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the snowbank. Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle. Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs. ANNAIt is not nice to throw people! Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back. KRISTOFFAll right feisty pants. Calm down. Woaw. Just let the snow man be. ANNALet me at him. I want to get him. I.... Okay. IÕm Calm. 
Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and throws it at Marshmallow. The tiny little ball hits MarshmallowÕs back, not making even the slightest dent. But itÕs enough to infuriate him. He 
ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints. KRISTOFFUh-oh. Now you made him mad!OLAF...IÕll distract him. You guys go. 
Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite direction. OlafÕs belly and butt fall and follow Sven.  
OLAF (CONTÕD)
No, no, not you guys. FROZEN - J. Lee         72Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as OlafÕs 
head falls and lands face down in snow.OLAF (CONTÕD)
(muffled)This just got a whole lot harder.Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard right behind them. TheyÕre off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail. KRISTOFFThis way!Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
(impressed)Ho-ho-ho!ANNAI got him!Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge. KRISTOFFWhoa, stop!ANNAItÕs a hundred foot drop.
KRISTOFFItÕs two hundred. 
Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.ANNAOw.He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe. ANNA (CONTÕD)
WhatÕs that for? 
KRISTOFFIÕm digging a snow anchor.
FROZEN - J. Lee         73ANNA(not trusting)Okay. What if we fall?KRISTOFFThereÕs twenty feet of fresh powder down there; itÕll be like landing 
on a pillow.... Hopefully. They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
Okay, Anna. On three. Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.  ANNAOkay. You tell me when... KRISTOFFOne...ANNA...IÕm ready to go....
KRISTOFFTwo...ANNA(pumped up)...I was BORN ready! Yes!KRISTOFFCalm down. A huge tree flies through the air toward them.ANNA (O.S.)TREE!Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches their fall.KRISTOFFWhoa! That happened. Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. HeÕs a complete 
mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs and puffs, struggling to run.OLAFAh. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. FROZEN - J. Lee         74He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.OLAF (CONTÕD)
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! WhereÕd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there! Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him. OLAF (CONTÕD)
(happily)Hey. We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things. Marshmallow roars and approaches KristoffÕs snow anchor. 
OLAF (CONTÕD)
NO!Olaf jumps onto MarshmallowÕs leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference. OLAF (CONTÕD)
This is not making much of a difference!Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff. OLAF (CONTÕD)
WHOA!Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff. ANNAOlaf!OLAFHang in there, guys!Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and AnnaÕs rope up.
ANNAWait, what? KristoffÕs head hits the cliff. 
KRISTOFFAargghh!Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll. ANNAKristoff!FROZEN - J. Lee         75Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all over them. MARSHMALLOWDonÕt come back!
ANNA(grossed out by his snow breath)Ugh. We wonÕt. 
Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to just as they fall. They both SCREAM!SLAM!REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs. ANNA (CONTÕD)
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.She looks up to see OlafÕs upper half hanging onto KristoffÕs boots, which are sticking out of the snow. OLAF(shaking the boots)I canÕt feel my legs! I canÕt feel 
my legs!Suddenly, KristoffÕs head pops up. He spits out snow.
KRISTOFFThose are my legs. OlafÕs bottom goes running by. 
OLAF(to Kristoff)Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.Kristoff grabs OlafÕs head and puts it on his body. 
OLAF (CONTÕD)
Oh, that feels better. Sven walks up and sniffs OlafÕs nose. 
OLAF (CONTÕD)
Hey, Sven!FROZEN - J. Lee         76Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off his nose -- and misses. OLAF (CONTÕD)
He found us. (to Sven, funny voice)WhoÕs my cute little reindeer?KRISTOFFDonÕt talk to him like that.
Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.   KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
Here.He lifts her out easily. ANNA(impressed)Whoa! KRISTOFFYou okay?ANNAThank you.They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?ANNA (CONTÕD)
...Um.... HowÕs your head?
She touches the spot where he banged his head. KRISTOFF(in pain)Ah! Ooh! He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
I mean, ItÕs fine. Ah...IÕm good. 
Ha. IÕve got a thick skull.
OLAFI donÕt have a skull.... Or bones.  KRISTOFF...So.... The awkwardness is killing him. FROZEN - J. Lee         77KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)

to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then thereÕs your ice 
business--KRISTOFFHey, hey, donÕt worry about my ice 
business...(noticing something)Worry about your hair?! She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.ANNAWhat? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair. KRISTOFFNo, yours is turning white.  She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white. ANNAWhite? ItÕs what? 
KRISTOFFItÕs because she struck you; isnÕt 
it? ANNADoes it look bad?KRISTOFF(thinking)...No. OlafÕs head pops up. HeÕs holding his head up off his body to join the conversation.OLAFYou hesitated. KRISTOFFNo, I didnÕt. Anna, you need help. 
Now, come on. FROZEN - J. Lee         78He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow. OLAFOkay! Where are we going? KRISTOFFTo see my friends.ANNA(catching up)The love experts? OLAFLove experts?!KRISTOFFYes. And donÕt worry; theyÕll be 
able to fix this.   ANNAHow do you know?  He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child.KRISTOFF...Because IÕve seen them do it 
before. As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven. OLAFI like to consider myself a love expert. CUT TO:INT. ELSAÕS PALACE Ñ DAY
Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself. ELSA(mantra-style)Get it together. Control it. DonÕt

She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. SheÕs left a 
sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow up the wall, taking over the castle.DISSOLVE TO:FROZEN - J. Lee         79EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS Ñ NIGHTThe Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as he rides on SvenÕs back. 
OLAFLook, Sven. The skyÕs awake.
Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers. KRISTOFFAre you cold? ANNA...A little. He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides against it. He looks around as if he doesnÕt know what to do, then gets a thought. KRISTOFFWait. Come here. He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-lined pass. Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. He holds her hands over one of them. ANNAOooh.... ThatÕs nice. 
They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent. KRISTOFF(taking a deep breath)So, about my friends...well, I say friends, theyÕre more like 
family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in. ANNA(moved)They did?KRISTOFF(nervous ramble)Yeah. I donÕt want to scare you,  
they can be a little bit inappropriate...and loud...very loud...theyÕre also stubborn at 
times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. FROZEN - J. Lee         80(MORE)But theyÕre fine.. YouÕll get it. 
They mean well.Anna touches KristoffÕs arm, reassuringly.

OLAF(realizing)HeÕs crazy.

Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle. HANSWe are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen. Do you understand?The DukeÕs thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow 
rises from the ground behind Hans. ItÕs Marshmallow, ElsaÕs 
snow guard. MARSHMALLOWGo away!He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow, who quickly knocks them over.Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword, leaps, and grabs it. Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.The DukeÕs two thugs see her. DUKEÕS THUGThe Queen.  The thugs charge up the stairs. FROZEN - J. Lee         88INT. ELSAÕS PALACE Ñ DAY
They guards burst through the ice doors. Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue. They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.  ELSA(scared)No. Please.One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches from her face. The thugs reposition to take another shot. ELSA (CONTÕD)
Stay away! Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and continue the attack. THUGGet her! Get her!Elsa fights for her life.  BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices MarshmallowÕs leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles 
back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge. REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and they rush into the ice palace.INT. ICE PALACE Ñ DAYElsa is surrounded. ItÕs do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck. The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK. OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug is pushed to the edge. HeÕs inches away from falling to his 
death. BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and the thugs near death.FROZEN - J. Lee         89HANSQueen Elsa! DonÕt be the monster 
they fear you are. Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened, moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened.The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice spikes lower from the second thugÕs neck. He takes advantage and aims his crossbow at ElsaÕs back. 
Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging directly above Elsa.The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN. Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast. All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out. CUT TO BLACK.FADE IN ON:ElsaÕs face as her eyes flutter open. 
She sits up. SheÕs surrounded by stone. 
INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON Ñ DAYElsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. SheÕs 
pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves. SheÕs chained to the wall. 
Elsa strains to looks out a window...INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting further buried under the ice and snow that is falling. ELSANo....What have I done? Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door. ELSA (CONTÕD)
Why did you bring me here? HANSI couldnÕt just let them kill you. 
FROZEN - J. Lee         90ELSABut IÕm a danger to Arendelle. Get

Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes. ELSA (CONTÕD)
You have to tell them to let me go. Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.HANSI will do what I can.He opens the door and leaves. Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up. CUT TO:EXT. THE FJORDS Ñ DAYSven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style. Anna shivers in KristoffÕs arms. SheÕs weakening. Kristoff 
takes off his hat and puts it on her head. KRISTOFFJust hang in there. (to Sven)Come on, buddy, faster!They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them, out of control.  OLAFIÕll meet you guys at the castle!

Anna looks up at him, gratefully. ANNA...Are you g-gonna be okay?KRISTOFF(touched, reassuring)DonÕt worry about me.
Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid rush to help Anna. GERDAAnna! Oh, you had us worried sick. KAIMy Lady. You are freezing. GERDAYou poor girl, youÕre freezing.

Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him. Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates. Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly follows.CUT TO:INT. LIBRARY Ñ DAYHans stands with the dignitaries and guards.HANSIÕm going back out to look for 
Princess Anna.FRENCH DIGNITARYYou cannot risk going out there again. HANSIf anything happens to her--SPANISH DIGNITARYIf anything happens to the Princess, you are all Arendelle has left. Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to depend on him. Is he really all they have left? Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna. KAI HeÕs in here. Prince Hans. 
HANSAnna. FROZEN - J. Lee         93Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.HANS (CONTÕD)

ANNA(weak, but desperate)Hans, you have to kiss me.  HANSWhat? ANNANow. Here we go.She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in his arms. GERDAWeÕll give you two some privacy. 
Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.  HANSWhat happened out there?ANNAElsa struck me with her powers. HANSYou said sheÕd never hurt you.ANNAI was wrong. Anna crumbles, weak. HANSAnna.Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.  ANNA(shivering more)She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me. HANS(understanding)A true loveÕs kiss. He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile. He leans in slowly...gently... FROZEN - J. Lee         94Then he stops. HANS (CONTÕD)
Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you. ANNAWhat? Hans gets up, leaving her there. ANNA (CONTÕD)
...You said you did.He goes to the window and shuts the curtains. HANSAs thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didnÕt stand a chance. I knew IÕd have to marry into the 
throne somewhere-- ANNAWhat are you talking about? HANS(putting out the candles)As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you- ANNAHans?HANSYou were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that.Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace. HANS (CONTÕD)
I figured, after we married, IÕd 
have to stage a little accident for Elsa.  Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak. ANNAHans. No, stop.FROZEN - J. Lee         95HANSBut then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her. ANNAPlease. HANS(chuckles)All thatÕs left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer. Hans approaches Anna.ANNA...YouÕre no match for Elsa.
He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently.HANSNo, youÕre no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction. She wrenches her face out of his hands. ANNA(anger)You wonÕt get away with this.
Hans rises and crosses to the door.HANSOh, I already have.  Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.

The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is  devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.GUARD (O.S.)SheÕs dangerous. Move quickly and 
with resolve.Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men duck out of the way. Hans pushes his way into the room...sees... The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the floor. Elsa is gone. CUT TO:EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE Ñ DAYKristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not wanting to follow.

Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
Hey, watch it. WhatÕs wrong with 
you? Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)

KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
No, Sven! WeÕre not going back! 
Sven shakes his head, angrily. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
SheÕs with her true love.
Sven makes an Òof-course-she-isnÕtÓ face. Kristoff gets it; 
heÕs made his point. 
Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)

We see a carrot in the lock and hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there. OLAFAnna. Oh no.He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood, including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues, before striking a match and relighting the fire. FROZEN - J. Lee         99ANNAOlaf? Olaf.

OLAF(confident)ThatÕs okay, I do.... 
Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder. FROZEN - J. Lee         100OLAF (CONTÕD)

OLAF (sweet and reassuring)Some people are worth melting for. But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow back in place. OLAF (CONTÕD)
Just maybe not right this second. Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in. OLAF (CONTÕD)
DonÕt worry, IÕve got it! 
Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel.OLAF (CONTÕD)

OLAFNo, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm. ANNAI need to get to Kristoff. OLAF(clueless)Why...? (realizing)Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

He runs top speed towards her. ThereÕs still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is

ANNACome on. Come on. Come on. Come on! She runs him right into a pole. KRISTOFFPole.ANNAOops. Sorry.EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS Ñ DAYAnna skips to the perfect spot and stops. ANNA(stopping)Okay. Okay. Here we are.FROZEN - J. Lee         109She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in front of it -- Vanna White-style. ANNA (CONTÕD)
I owe you a sled. KRISTOFF(blown away)Are you serious? ANNAYes. And itÕs the latest model.  
KRISTOFFNo. I canÕt accept this... 
ANNAYou have to. No returns. No exchanges. QueenÕs orders. SheÕs 
named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like heÕs 
king of the bucks. KRISTOFFWhat? ThatÕs not a thing.
But he canÕt help but admire her enthusiasm.
ANNASure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it? KRISTOFFLike it? He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around. KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
I love it.... I could kiss you!He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.  KRISTOFF (CONTÕD)
...I could. I mean IÕd like to. 
IÕd... may I? We me....I mean, may 
we? Wait, what?She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek. ANNAWe may. FROZEN - J. Lee         110He smiles and goes for it. ItÕs a true loveÕs kiss, alright. 
We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.With his snow cloud safely overhead, heÕs free to smell the 
flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off. Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks the whole carrot into his mouth. ItÕs gone.
OlafÕs face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the carrot back out and jams it into OlafÕs face where it 
belongs. ItÕs completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf 
doesnÕt seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.
CUT TO:EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD Ñ DAYThe gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard, stands Elsa. ELSAAre you ready? Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about. Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds some snow flurries for atmosphere. Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her. ANNAI like the open gates.ELSAWe are never closing them again. Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally made of ice) form on AnnaÕs boots. 
ANNAWhat? Oh, Elsa, theyÕre beautiful, 
but you know I donÕt ska--
Elsa grabs AnnaÕs hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna slips and slides, but laughs in delight.Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him. KRISTOFFLook out. Reindeer coming through!FROZEN - J. Lee         111
