SULLEYI donÕt need to know any of that 
stuff to scare.HARDSCRABBLEThat "stuff" would have informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes.  So a roar wouldnÕt make him scream, it would 
make him cry, alerting his parents, exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course, we canÕt have that, so 
IÕm afraid I can not recommend that you continue in the scaring program, good day.SULLEY(laughing, then it dawns on him)Wait, what?  But IÕm a Sullivan.
HARDSCRABBLE(smiling)Well then, IÕm sure your family 
will be very disappointed.Sulley is incredulous, confused.  He looks up into the stands, just in time to see the door swing shut on Johnny and the RORs as they exit.Sulley canÕt believe this is happening.
He turns to Mike and stares at him with pure hate and then marches off.Mike watches Sulley leave, concerned.HARDSCRABBLE (CONTÕD)

The sun is just coming up as Mike sleeps in bed.  He rolls over, right into a blue furry hand.  He cuddles into the hand for a beat.PANNING WIDE we see that SulleyÕs arm is flopped out of his 
top bunk.  ItÕs so long it reaches down onto MikeÕs bed.
MIKE(snoring, murmuring)I know youÕre a princess and IÕm 
just a stable boy-Mike cuddles TENDERLY with the hand for another moment, then the alarm goes off.  His eye opens, and he sees SulleyÕs 
hand.MIKE (CONTÕD)
(cuddling noises, then)ACCHHHH!He pushes the hand away, flipping a sleeping Sulley out of the top bunk.  BAM!  Sulley lands on the floor, then pops up angrily.SULLEY(impact effort)What?!

Okay, so itÕs kind of cheating!  
But what do you want me to do?  TheyÕre not exactly the scariest 
group in the world.Sulley points to the misfits now distracted from their training, crowded around Squishy.SQUISHYOh, a ladybug!  Make a wish!  Make a wish!Art blows it off SquishyÕs arm.

Squishy is standing right behind him.78.      MIKE (CONTÕD)
AH!  Boy, we need to get you a bell.Mike turns to the group and pulls out the open envelope from the Scare Games and reads it.MIKE (CONTÕD)
Listen up!  ÒIf a kid hears you

ON VP and president surrounded by a group of onlookers in a nearby balcony overlooking the action.GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT(whispered to crowd)We are at the halfway point of the second event, and things are getting interesting.The misfits walk in line with Mike, revealing an annoyed Sulley.  Sulley looks ahead to see the HSS sisters as they reach for their flag.HSS SISTERGot it!They quickly get out of the library, having passed the test.The other two flags left hanging are green and purple for the two remaining teams.GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT(whispered)Only two teams left. 79.

SULLEY(whispered)FASTER!Mike corrects him-MIKE(whispered)Slow and steady.ART(whispered)Slow and steady.DON(whispered)Slow and steady.TERRI/TERRY(whispered)Slow and steady.SQUISHY(whispered)Slow and steady.The misfits relay the exact message down the line to Sulley the exact way Mike did.  They continue to move really slowly as Sulley is increasingly frustrated.Sulley canÕt take it.  He bolts forward, leaving his 
teammates behind.MikeÕs eye goes wide.

Everyone stops and looks back at the librarian.The librarian turns around at SulleyÕs noise but luckily she canÕt see very well.LIBRARIANHmmmm...She goes about her business.  Mike gives a sigh of relief.But he gasps when he sees Sulley racing to the top of the ladder.Sulley reaches for the Oozmas flag and almost gets it -But the ladder starts to come off the tracks under the strain.Sulley falls to the ground with a thunderous SLAM.The librarian spins toward the sound, and quickly runs  toward Sulley.LIBRARIAN (CONTÕD)

ItÕs DON!  And heÕs on his hands and knees crawling along the floor.  His tentacles are making a loud, sticky, suction cup sound.LIBRARIANGrrrr...The librarian leaves Sulley behind and makes a beeline for DON, her tentacles shooting toward him.83.      Now itÕs DonÕs turn to cringe, bracing for impact.  Just 
before the librarian reaches Don...Terri and Terry start-up their crazy dance moves.TERRI(yelling)5, 6, 7, 8!  Da-Da-da-da-da...look over here!TERRYOver here!  Ahhhh!TERRIDa-da-da-da!  Over here now....The librarian stops in her tracks and now she turns towards Terri and Terry.Now itÕs Terri and TerryÕs turn to be scared.  But just as 
the librarianÕs tentacle reaches for them--
Art is now standing on top of a table stomping his feet and laughing hysterically.ON VP and member of the crowd.CROWD MEMBERIs that legal?GREEK COUNCIL VPYou better believe it, mop top!  The only rule is donÕt get caught.
As the librarian guns for Art, he somersaults off the table and rolls around in front of her, laughing like a mad man.Mike looks on, horrified.The EEKs are using a human rope to get to their flag.Art continues rolling right past Sulley.  Terri and Terry shout at the librarian.TERRI/TERRY(shouting)Over here!  As the librarian pursues Terri and Terry, one of her tentacles knocks the EEK pyramid over.TERRI/TERRY (CONTÕD)(shouting)Come and get me!  Come get me!84.

Squishy is dancing with the PNKs.SQUISHYI've never stayed up this late in my life.PNK SISTERS(laughing)Squishy is having a great time on the dance floor and spies Sulley standing by himself.  He decides to lasso him onto the dance floor.  Sulley is not amused.  Squishy is undeterred and begins ÒreelingÓ him in.  Sulley gives into his 
enthusiasm and reluctantly hops his way onto the dance floor with the rest of the misfits.SQUISHYWOO!PARTY MONSTERSWoo-woo!  Woo-woo!Mike wanders to a hallway at the side of the party where portraits of the great Scare Game winners are located.  He sees the Scare Games trophy, set on a pedestal at the end of the room.  As he approaches, Mike sees his reflection in it.  Distorted by its shape, he looks big and impressive.  Mike raises his claws and makes a small growl face.ON JOHNNY as he addresses the party crowd.89.      JOHNNY(whistle)Hey, quiet!  QUIET!  Quiet down you can wranglers!

Squishy holds the trophy, admiring it.SULLEY(laughing)You guys killed it out there....ART(laughing)Awesome.Sulley laughs as he looks for Mike.SULLEY(calling out)Hey Wazowski!  Come on, letÕs go, 
you maniac!  WeÕre celebrating!
Sulley finds Mike standing alone in the OozmaÕs simulator.
SULLEY (CONTÕD)
Mike?Mike is beaming, lost in his own little world.MIKEI did it.  I canÕt believe it.Sulley smiles....Mike turns around.MIKE (CONTÕD)
IÕm gonna be a scarer!
SULLEY(laughing)Yeah, yes, you are!Mike turns to the sim kid one more time.MIKEHey, you hear that?  Get plenty of rest kidd-o....You havenÕt seen the last of Mike Wazowski.  BOO!Mike playfully throws his hands in the air toward the sim kid --to his shock the sim kid shoots out of bed and lets out a terrifying scream, reacting just as wildly as it did in the competition.Mike leaps back in shock.Mike turns to see the can fill all the way to the top.125.      Sulley says nothing, he looks confused, slightly worried.MIKE (CONTÕD)
I knew I was scary, I didnÕt know I was that scary....Mike chuckles awkwardly, clearly confused.SULLEY(covering)Yeah, weÕre so scary, I guess we 
broke it.  CÕmon.  
But Mike approaches the bed slowly, his smile fading.  Mike leans in and snaps his fingers right by the sim kidÕs head.  The dummy shoots back into the air and screams.Confused, Mike lifts the bed skirt to reveal a control panel.  We see a row of six gauges with a row down labeled ÒEasy,Ó 
ÒMedium,Ó and ÒHard.Ó
MIKEItÕs been tampered with.
SULLEYUh, I donÕt think you should be 
messing with that.MIKEWhy are my settings...different?Suddenly it dawns on Mike.SULLEYMike, we should leave.Mike looks at Sulley.  Sulley looks cornered.  Suddenly it dawns on Mike.MIKEDid you do this?SULLEYMike.MIKEDID YOU do this?Sulley struggles then...SULLEY(ashamed)I...yes, I did, but you donÕt understand--126.      MIKEWhy?!  Why did you do this?MikeÕs face drops, his heart breaks.SULLEY(sigh)You know, just in case...MIKEIn case of what?Sulley lifts his head and looks at Mike.  Suddenly it all dawns on Mike.MIKE (CONTÕD)
You donÕt think IÕm scary.
SULLEYMike...MIKE(hurt)You said you believed in me....(then, angry)But youÕre just like Hardscrabble.  YouÕre just like everyone else.
SULLEYLook, youÕll get better and better-
MIKEIÕm as scary as you!  IÕm as scary 
as anyone!SULLEYI just wanted to help.MIKENo, you just wanted to help yourself!SULLEYWell, what was I supposed to do?  Let the whole team fail because you donÕt have it?!
And just like that, SulleyÕs said it.  And Mike is thrown for a second.  Then his eye narrows, and he storms off.As he does, REVEAL the misfits, who are standing just off the stage.  They saw the whole thing, and they look hurt/confused /disappointed/angry.127.      While the others walk away, Squishy sets down the trophy and shuffles off with them....ON SULLEY as he tries to process how totally wrong everythingÕs gone.  In what was supposed to be a triumphant 
moment, heÕs alone - confused, angry, frustrated....
INT. MU DOOR TECH LABTwo door lab students walk by and reveal Mike leaning up against a wall across from the door tech lab.DOOR LAB STUDENT #1So your calculations were a little off.DOOR LAB STUDENT #2That door took me ALL semester.DOOR LAB STUDENT #3ItÕs too dangerous, the professorÕs

He just moves past the students, numb, and glances at his sad reflection in the trophy.PROFESSOR KNIGHTSullivan!Sulley looks up from the trophy to see Professor Knight.PROFESSOR KNIGHT (CONTÕD)
Nice work out there.  I look forward to having you back in class.Sulley looks conflicted as Knight heads to the School of Scaring.128.

CHETYouÕre a ROR, buddy!Sulley looks at Johnny, then past him... he sees Knight talking to Dean Hardscrabble, at the entrance to the School of Scaring.A look of resolve comes over SulleyÕs face - he knows what he has to do.He hands the jacket AND the trophy to Johnny and runs off....JOHNNY(flustered)Hey!  Where are you going-?INT. MU DOOR TECH LABMike stares at the door lab.  Several students shut off the light and come out of the lab.Mike casually walks by them, grabbing one of their card keys.  Glancing around, he swipes the card.  He waits for the green light and opens the door, heading in.EXT. SCHOOL OF SCARING/QUADSulley is in mid-confession to Hardscrabble and Knight.129.

He powers up the door.In the background, we hear security guards trying to get in.  Mike has blocked the door with a cart full of scream cans.SECURITY GUARDS(walla)Open the door!/DonÕt go in 
there!/ItÕs very dangerous!
He stands there, unflinching in front of the door.  The light turns on above the door and Mike turns the knob.INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTIn the human world, a closet door opens.  Mike steps through it and quietly shuts the door.  HeÕs in the human world!
MIKE(big exhale)He makes his silent, stealthy approach towards the bed, building a scary mood.The kid slowly sits up, sensing something....Suddenly Mike leaps up and ROARS.MIKE (CONTÕD)

Mike roars again.MIKEROAR!Then the kid smiles.KID #1You look funny.ON MIKE, as he reacts, confused/disappointed/upset.MIKE(confused)What?Mike hears a COUGH offscreen.131.      The camera pulls out to reveal heÕs in a cabin full of beds, a kid bunked down in each one.  A banner hangs on the wall, reading, ÒCamp Teamwork.Ó
The other kids start to wake up.  Groggily, they stare at Mike.KIDS(waking up walla)WhatÕs going on?/ItÕs the middle of 
the night./HeÕs a little funny

Sulley moves to the front of the crowd near the misfits.  Inside the lab, Hardscrabble oversees additional security personnel who are securing the door and investigating the scene.DONYou donÕt think that could be-SULLEYItÕs Mike.

Folks, today is your lucky day, how many times have you asked yourself the following question--Hardscrabble stares at Don, not buying it.HARDSCRABBLE(dismissive)Arrest him.Suddenly, two guards throttle Don against the wall.133.      DONPardon?(impact)Ahhh!SECURITY GUARDSpread Ôem, Pops!
DONDo you mind?!SECURITY GUARDDonÕt move!Sulley runs for the door.When SulleyÕs almost to the door, Hardscrabble spots him out of the corner of her eye.HARDSCRABBLEWhat?  Sullivan!  Don't you dare!He grabs the door handle....HARDSCRABBLE (CONTÕD)
Sullivan, donÕt go in there!  Sulley quickly looks back toward Hardscrabble, ignores her and slips through the door.INT. CAMP TEAMWORK - NIGHTSulley creeps through the cabin, which is empty.  Where is Mike?SULLEY(whisper)Mike?  Mike?Sulley hears voices outside and crosses to a window.  Some camp counselors are gathered in front of one of the kidsÕ 
cabins, relating the events of the night to some park rangers.  The flashing lights of the rangerÕs cruiser strobe through the cabin.COUNSELORThe kids are saying they saw something in the cabin.COUNSELOR #2TheyÕre calling it an alien.

A bear in the camp!Sulley takes off running, jumping down into a gully, evading the lights.Sulley sprints through the woods.  He bursts through some brush and comes to the edge of a lake.He scans the lake but hears men yelling and ducks behind a rack of canoes, seeing flashlights in the distance.RANGERS(walla)Down there, everybody over here...I heard something over here.Sulley hears a splash and turns to see Mike sitting at the foot of the lake, staring at his reflection in the water.SULLEY(gasp then sigh of relief)Mike!Mike doesnÕt look back.
135.      SULLEY (CONTÕD)
CÕmon buddy, letÕs get you out of

SULLEY (CONTÕD)
This is all my fault...IÕm sorry---
Mike continues to look down.MIKE(depressed)You were right, they werenÕt scared of me.Sulley moves closer and looks down at Mike, silent.MIKE (CONTÕD)
I did everything right.  I wanted it more than anyone.  And I thought, I thought if I wanted it enough, I could show everybody that...Mike stares at his reflection in the water.MIKE (CONTÕD)
That Mike Wazowski is something special, and IÕm just...not.  He splashes it away.SULLEYLook Mike, I know how you feel---MIKEDonÕt do that.  Please donÕt do 
that.  You DO NOT know how I feel.MikeÕs raises his voice, Sulley looks around cautiously.
SULLEYMike, calm down.MIKEMonsters like you have everything. You donÕt have to be good, you can 
mess up over and over again, and the whole world loves you.SULLEYMike-136.      MIKEYouÕll never know what itÕs like to 
fail, because you were born a Sullivan!SULLEYYeah, IÕm a Sullivan!  IÕm the Sullivan who flunked every test, the one who got kicked out of the program.  The one who was so afraid to let everyone down, that I cheated, and I lied.  (sigh)Mike, IÕll never know how you feel, but youÕre not the only failure 
here.SulleyÕs shoulders drop, he sits down next to Mike.
SULLEY (CONTÕD)
I act scary Mike, but most of the time...IÕm terrified.
MIKEHow come you never told me that before?SULLEYBecause...we werenÕt friends 
before.Mike is stunned, at a loss for words.Suddenly a flashlight grazes Sulley.Sulley jumps back as the lights come toward him.Mike hides behind a rock as he watches Sulley driven away.Mike is in shock.  Sulley looks back at Mike, they both donÕt know what to do.  After a second, Sulley just takes off running.RANGERS(walla)Over there...Sulley runs through the darkness and right into an EMBANKMENT.He tries to climb the slippery side of the embankment but the flashlights are getting closer.137.      Just as he is struggling, a tree limb is suddenly lowered down next to him.MIKESulley.Sulley looks up - itÕs Mike, at the top of the embankment.  
SulleyÕs surprised....
In the distance, the sound of humans is getting closer, and we can make out flashlights in the trees.Mike lowers the tree branch a little more, bracing his feet against some rocks.He pulls Sulley up over the edge.  They take off back toward the cabin.EXT. CABIN - NIGHTThe rangers are surrounding the cabin.Mike and Sulley see an opening and sprint toward the cabin.  INT.

Squishy breaks the line, tearfully charging for his friends, but heÕs held back with ease by security.
HARDSCRABBLEEnough!  I want this room cleared, now!Security starts herding students out of the lab.MISFITS(walla)Hey, you canÕt do this!/Please

They approach the cabin, shining flashlights.Sulley runs away.SULLEYWeÕve gotta get out of here.
Mike gets an idea.MIKE(whispered)Let them come!139.      SULLEY(whispered)What?Sulley looks at Mike, confused.MIKEIf we scare them, I mean really scare them...we could generate enough scream to power the door from this side.SULLEYWhat are you talking about?!MIKEI have read every book about scaring ever written.  This could work!SULLEY TheyÕre ADULTS!  I canÕt do this!
MIKEYes you can, just follow my lead.CUT TO:ON THE DOOR to the cabin.  The doorknob turns, then rangers pour in, flashlights pointing into the darkness.They jump as a fan turns on suddenly, then slows to a stop.The window drapes flutter, as if someone has just touched them.The rangers proceed farther into the cabin.Up in the rafters, Sulley and Mike nod at each other.  Mike counts down silently as they get ready for their next action.BAM!  The front door of the cabin slams shut behind the rangers.The rangers hear music.  They spin around and see a record player, playing a record backward.They hear another sound and turn their flashlights on a doll walking across the cabin.DOLLMa-ma.  Ma-ma.The doll walks into a bed post and falls down.140.      DOLL (CONTÕD)
(warbled)Ma-ma.  Ma-ma...They see a dark shadow run across the floor behind them.  ItÕs Mike.
Sulley reaches down behind the rangers and scrapes the floor with his claws.  The rangers turn in time to see the claw marks on the floor.They hear something in the rafters.  Shining their flashlights in that direction they see more claw marks on the walls all around them.They hear a deep, low growl as something short and round scurries across the floor.SULLEY(growl)RANGERWhat the-RANGERS(gasp)Whoa!Just before their flashlights reach Mike, Sulley reaches down and pulls him up into the rafters again like a basketball.RANGERS (CONTÕD)

Stop being a Sullivan, and start being you.Sulley looks uncertain.RANGER #1Call for backup!RANGER #2Assistance on the north side.  Repeat, we need assistance on the north side. Mike jumps down from the rafters behind the rangers.  He grabs a fishing pole and ties some of the line to a table leg.  He runs around the room, encircling the rangers.RANGERS(walla)What was it?/LetÕs go!
The rangers are spooked.From a hiding place behind a piece of furniture, Mike locks eyes with Sulley and nods.  It sinks in, Sulley becomes determined.  ItÕs time.
142.      RANGERS (CONTÕD)

Sulley drops from the rafters, landing in front of the rangers.  He begins to let out a deep growl....As the rangers recoil in horror, Mike tightens the fishing line around the rangerÕs legs causing them to fall and get 
tangled in the line.  As the rangers struggle on the floor, Sulley looms over them and lets out a ferocious roar.SULLEYROAR!!The ranger screams are overwhelming....CUT TO:INT.
